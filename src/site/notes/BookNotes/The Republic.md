# Introduction to Justice in Plato's The Republic柏拉圖《理想國》中的正義概論

Plato's "The Republic" is a foundational text in Western philosophy and political theory, primarily exploring the nature of justice and the ideal city. Through the character of Socrates, Plato delves into profound questions about what it means to be just, both as individuals and as a society. The dialogue remains relevant today, prompting readers to reflect on justice's role in personal and communal life.柏拉圖的《理想國》是西方哲學和政治理論的基礎文本，主要探討正義的本質和理想城市。 透過蘇格拉底這個人物，柏拉圖深入探討了關於正義對個人和社會意義的深刻問題。 這段對話至今仍具有現實意義，促使讀者反思正義在個人和公共生活中的作用。

# Defining Justice定義正義

Socrates engages with various interlocutors to dissect their definitions of justice. The first definition comes from Polemarchus, who suggests that justice is giving each person what they are owed. Socrates challenges this by presenting scenarios where returning something owed could lead to harm, such as returning weapons to an unstable person. This leads to the conclusion that justice cannot simply be about fulfilling obligations.蘇格拉底與不同的對話者接觸，剖析他們對正義的定義。 第一個定義來自 Polemarchus，他認為正義是給予每個人應得的。 蘇格拉底透過提出返還欠款可能導致傷害的場景來挑戰這一點，例如將武器回饋給情緒不穩定的人。 由此得出的結論是，正義不能僅僅在於履行義務。

Polemarchus then proposes that justice involves helping friends and harming enemies. Socrates counters this by arguing that harming others ultimately harms the individual doing the harming, as it corrupts their moral character. Furthermore, the difficulty in accurately identifying friends and enemies complicates this definition.波勒馬庫斯隨後提出，正義包括幫助朋友和傷害敵人。 蘇格拉底反駁道，傷害他人最終會傷害實施傷害的個人，因為這會腐蝕他們的道德品質。 此外，準確識別朋友和敵人的困難使這個定義變得複雜。

Thrasymachus offers a third definition, claiming that justice is whatever benefits the ruler. Socrates refutes this by asserting that a true ruler should prioritize the welfare of the city over personal gain, similar to how a doctor must focus on the health of their patients. These discussions culminate in an impasse, revealing the complexity of defining justice.色拉敘馬科斯提出了第三個定義，聲稱正義是對統治者有利的一切。 蘇格拉底反駁了這一點，聲稱真正的統治者應該優先考慮城市的福利而不是個人利益，就像醫生必須關注病人的健康一樣。 這些討論最終陷入僵局，揭示了定義正義的複雜性。

# Justice in Relation to Individual and City關於個人和城市的正義

Socrates proposes that justice cannot be understood in isolation from the individual and the city. He introduces the idea that justice involves individuals minding their own business—fulfilling their roles within society. A well-ordered city requires citizens to recognize and perform their specific duties, which contributes to the overall harmony and justice of the community.蘇格拉底提出，正義不能脫離個人和城市來理解。 他提出了這樣的觀點：正義涉及個人專注於自己的事情——履行他們在社會中的角色。 一個秩序良好的城市需要公民認識並履行自己的具體職責，這有助於社區的整體和諧與正義。

In a just city, each person has a role that aligns with their abilities, ensuring that the needs of the city and its citizens are met symbiotically. A just ruler governs for the benefit of the city, contrasting with a tyrant who rules for personal gain. Thus, individual justice is intertwined with the justice of the city.在一個公正的城市中，每個人都發揮與其能力相符的作用，確保城市及其公民的需求得到共生滿足。 公正的統治者為了城市的利益而統治，與為個人利益而統治的暴君形成鮮明對比。 因此，個人正義與城市正義交織在一起。

# Essence vs. Appearance of Justice正義的本質與外表

A significant theme in "The Republic" is the distinction between the essence of justice and its appearance. Socrates argues that the worst form of injustice is to appear just while being unjust. Glaucon challenges Socrates by suggesting that many people prefer the appearance of justice over true justice. Socrates counters this by asserting that genuine justice is inherently more desirable and beneficial.《理想國》的一個重要主題是正義的本質和表象之間的區別。 蘇格拉底認為，最糟糕的不公正形式是在不公正的同時表現出正義。 格勞孔挑戰蘇格拉底，認為許多人更喜歡表面的正義而不是真正的正義。 蘇格拉底反駁道，真正的正義本質上是更可取和有益的。

He emphasizes that true character is revealed through actions and relationships, not mere appearances. A just individual cannot exist in an unjust city, as the laws and structures of the city shape the moral character of its citizens. Therefore, a just society is essential for cultivating just individuals.他強調，真正的性格是透過行為和關係來揭示的，而不僅僅是外表。 一個公正的個人不可能存在於一個不公正的城市中，因為城市的法律和結構塑造了其公民的道德品質。 因此，公正的社會必須培養出公正的個人。

# The Role of Education and the Noble Lie教育的作用和高尚的謊言

Socrates highlights the importance of education in fostering justice. A sound education nurtures both the mind and body, preparing citizens to contribute positively to society. Music and gymnastics serve as examples of how education can cultivate a balanced character and promote social cohesion.蘇格拉底強調了教育對於促進正義的重要性。 良好的教育可以滋養身心，幫助公民為社會做出正面貢獻。 音樂和體操是教育如何培養平衡性格和促進社會凝聚力的例子。

Additionally, Socrates introduces the concept of the "noble lie," a myth designed to instill a sense of unity and purpose among citizens. This lie connects individuals to their city, fostering loyalty and a sense of shared identity. By promoting a collective understanding of their origins and responsibilities, the noble lie helps ensure that citizens act in the city's best interest.此外，蘇格拉底引入了「高貴的謊言」的概念，這是一個旨在向公民灌輸團結感和目標感的神話。 這個謊言將個人與他們的城市連結起來，培養忠誠度和共同的認同感。 透過促進對其出身和責任的集體理解，崇高的謊言有助於確保公民的行為符合城市的最佳利益。

# The Analogy of City and Soul城市與靈魂的類比

Socrates draws a parallel between the structure of a just city and the human soul. He posits that both the city and the soul consist of three parts: reason, spirit, and desire. The rulers, representing reason, govern the city; the soldiers, embodying spirit, defend it; and the workers, driven by desire, fulfill the city's material needs.蘇格拉底將正義城市的結構與人類靈魂進行了類比。 他認為城市和靈魂都由三個部分組成：理性、精神和慾望。 統治者代表理性，統治城市； 戰士體現精神，捍衛精神； 工人們則在慾望的驅使下，滿足城市的物質需求。

This tripartite structure emphasizes that a just city requires harmony among its parts, just as a just individual must balance reason, spirit, and desire. The health of the city reflects the health of its citizens, and vice versa, reinforcing the interconnectedness of individual and communal justice.這種三重結構強調正義的城市需要其各部分之間的和諧，就像正義的個人必須平衡理性、精神和慾望一樣。 城市的健康反映了公民的健康，反之亦然，從而加強了個人和社區正義的相互聯繫。

# Philosopher Kings哲學家國王

In Socrates' vision of the ideal city, philosophers must be the rulers. He argues that only those who seek wisdom and possess a balanced soul can govern justly. The philosopher king embodies rationality and virtue, ensuring that laws are created for the common good rather than personal gain.在蘇格拉底的理想城市願景中，哲學家必須是統治者。 他認為，只有那些尋求智慧並擁有平衡靈魂的人才能公正地治理國家。 哲學家國王體現了理性和美德，確保法律是為了共同利益而不是個人利益而製定的。

Philosopher kings are tasked with educating citizens and determining their roles within the city. Their leadership is essential for maintaining justice and harmony, as they prioritize the well-being of the community over individual desires.哲學家國王的任務是教育公民並確定他們在城市中的角色。 他們的領導力對於維護正義與和諧至關重要，因為他們將社區福祉置於個人願望之上。

# Challenges of Philosophical Leadership哲學領導力的挑戰

Socrates acknowledges the difficulties philosophers face in ruling and educating others. Rational ideas often clash with ingrained beliefs and societal norms. He illustrates this struggle through the allegory of the cave, where prisoners mistake shadows for reality. Philosophers, akin to those who escape the cave, seek to enlighten others but often encounter resistance from those who prefer the comfort of familiar illusions.蘇格拉底承認哲學家在統治和教育他人時所面臨的困難。 理性的想法常常與根深蒂固的信念和社會規範發生衝突。 他透過洞穴的寓言來說明這場鬥爭，在洞穴中，囚犯將影子誤認為是現實。 哲學家就像那些逃離洞穴的人一樣，尋求啟發他人，但經常遇到那些喜歡熟悉幻想的安慰的人的抵制。

The journey from ignorance to knowledge is fraught with challenges, but it is essential for achieving a just society. Philosophers must navigate these obstacles to guide citizens toward a deeper understanding of justice and the good.從無知到知識的過程充滿挑戰，但它對於實現公正的社會至關重要。 哲學家必須克服這些障礙，引導公民更深入地理解正義和善。

# Forms of Government政府形式

Socrates categorizes five forms of government, ranking them from best to worst: aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny. Aristocracy, characterized by the rule of the best (philosopher kings), is deemed the ideal form. Timocracy, based on honor, follows but lacks the rational foundation of aristocracy.蘇格拉底將政府形式從最好到最差分為五種：貴族制、帝王制、寡頭制、民主制和暴政。 以最好的人（哲學家國王）統治為特徵的貴族制被認為是理想的形式。 以榮譽為基礎的君權政治，遵循但缺乏貴族政治的理性基礎。

Oligarchy, where wealth dictates power, leads to conflict between social classes. Democracy, while promoting freedom, can devolve into chaos without a guiding principle. Ultimately, tyranny emerges as the worst form of government, where a ruler prioritizes personal gain over the common good.財富決定權力的寡頭政治會導致社會階層之間的衝突。 民主在促進自由的同時，如果沒有指導原則，也可能陷入混亂。 最終，暴政成為最糟糕的政府形式，統治者將個人利益置於公共利益之上。

# Conclusion結論

In "The Republic," Plato, through Socrates, explores the nature of justice and its implications for individuals and society. He argues for a just city that nurtures just citizens, emphasizing the importance of education, the noble lie, and the role of philosopher kings. The dialogue ultimately asserts that true justice is preferable to injustice, advocating for a harmonious relationship between individuals and their communities.在《理想國》中，柏拉圖透過蘇格拉底探討了正義的本質及其對個人和社會的影響。 他主張建立一個公正的城市，培養公正的公民，並強調教育的重要性、高尚的謊言和哲學家國王的角色。 對話最終斷言，真正的正義優於不公正，倡導個人與其社區之間的和諧關係。

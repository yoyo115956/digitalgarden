# Introduction to Dune沙丘簡介

Frank Herbert's "Dune," published in 1965, is a seminal work in the science fiction genre, notable for its intricate world-building and exploration of complex themes such as politics, ecology, and religion. Despite its age, the novel has remained relevant, especially following Denis Villeneuve's 2021 film adaptation, which, while visually stunning, did not fully satisfy the expectations of many fans. This summary delves into the rich narrative and thematic depth of the original novel, illustrating why it is considered unparalleled in the sci-fi genre.法蘭克‧赫伯特 (Frank Herbert) 於 1965 年出版的《沙丘》是科幻小說類型中的一部開創性作品，以其錯綜複雜的世界建構和對政治、生態和宗教等複雜主題的探索而聞名。 儘管年代久遠，這部小說仍然具有現實意義，尤其是在丹尼斯·維倫紐夫於 2021 年改編成電影之後，該小說雖然在視覺上令人驚嘆，但並沒有完全滿足許多粉絲的期望。 本摘要深入探討了原著小說豐富的敘事和主題深度，說明了為什麼它被認為是科幻類型中無與倫比的。

# The Complex Universe of Dune沙丘的複雜宇宙

"Dune" is set in a distant future where humanity has spread across the galaxy, living in a feudal empire ruled by an emperor and divided into noble houses. The story begins with the transfer of control of the desert planet Arrakis from the House of Harkonnen to the House of Atreides, led by Duke Leto. Arrakis is the only source of melange, or spice, a valuable substance that enhances mental abilities and is crucial for space travel. The Atreides family, including Duke Leto and his son Paul, must navigate the political intrigue and hostility from the Harkonnens, who are determined to reclaim their lost territory.《沙丘》的故事發生在遙遠的未來，人類遍佈銀河系，生活在一個由皇帝統治、劃分為貴族家族的封建帝國。 故事開始於沙漠星球阿拉吉斯的控制權從哈科寧家族轉移到萊托公爵領導的阿崔迪家族。 阿拉吉斯是混合物或香料的唯一來源，香料是一種寶貴的物質，可以增強智力，對太空旅行至關重要。 包括萊托公爵和他的兒子保羅在內的阿崔迪家族必須應對哈科寧家族的政治陰謀和敵意，而哈科寧家族決心收復失地。

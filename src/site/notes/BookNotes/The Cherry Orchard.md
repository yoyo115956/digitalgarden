# Introduction to Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard契訶夫的《櫻桃園》簡介

Anton Chekhov's play, The Cherry Orchard, is a significant work in Russian literature that captures the essence of societal transformation during a time of great change. Chekhov, known for his deep understanding of human psychology, presents a narrative that intertwines masterful storytelling with a poignant reflection on the decline of the aristocracy and the rise of the bourgeoisie. The play revolves around the Ranevsky family, who face the loss of their ancestral estate, including the cherished cherry orchard, symbolizing their heritage and memories.安東‧契訶夫的戲劇《櫻桃園》是俄國文學中的重要作品，它抓住了巨變時期社會轉型的本質。 契訶夫以其對人類心理的深刻理解而聞名，他的敘述將精湛的故事講述與對貴族衰落和資產階級崛起的深刻反思交織在一起。 該劇圍繞著拉涅夫斯基一家展開，他們面臨著失去祖傳財產的問題，其中包括象徵著他們的遺產和記憶的珍貴櫻桃園。

# The Ranevsky Family and Their Struggles拉涅夫斯基家族及其鬥爭

The play opens with Madame Ranevskaya returning to her estate after a five-year absence in Paris. She is greeted by her brother Gaev and her two daughters, Anya and Varya. Although the reunion is joyful, it is overshadowed by the family's dire financial situation. The estate is in disrepair, and they are unable to maintain it. The looming threat of selling the estate and the cherry orchard hangs over them, representing not just a loss of property but a loss of identity and history.該劇以拉涅夫斯卡婭夫人在離開巴黎五年後回到自己的莊園開始。 迎接她的是她的兄弟蓋夫和她的兩個女兒安雅和瓦莉亞。 雖然團聚是歡樂的，但家庭嚴峻的經濟狀況卻為這一切蒙上了陰影。 莊園年久失修，他們無力維護。 出售莊園和櫻桃園的威脅迫在眉睫，這不僅意味著財產的損失，還意味著身份和歷史的喪失。

Lopakhin, a wealthy businessman and the son of former serfs, emerges as a potential savior for the family. He proposes a radical plan to demolish the cherry orchard and build summer cottages to generate income. However, Madame Ranevskaya and Gaev reject this idea, clinging to nostalgia for their past and the memories associated with the orchard. This conflict highlights the tension between the old aristocracy and the new social order represented by Lopakhin.洛帕欣是一位富商，也是前農奴的兒子，他成為這個家庭的潛在救星。 他提出了一項激進的計劃，拆除櫻桃園並建造避暑別墅以創造收入。 然而，拉涅夫斯卡婭夫人和加耶夫拒絕了這個想法，他們對自己的過去和與果園有關的記憶抱持懷舊之情。 這場衝突凸顯了舊貴族與洛帕金所代表的新社會秩序之間的緊張關係。

# The Clash of Old and New新舊的衝突

As the play progresses, the second act reveals the growing impatience of Lopakhin, who sees the Ranevsky family's sentimental attachment to the past as a hindrance to their survival. He engages in discussions with Trofimov, a radical student, who emphasizes the importance of work and the need for the aristocracy to adapt to the new economic realities. This conversation underscores the central theme of the play: the inability of the aristocracy to embrace change and the necessity of hard work for progress.隨著戲劇的進展，第二幕揭示了洛帕金越來越不耐煩，他認為拉涅夫斯基家族對過去的情感依戀是他們生存的障礙。 他與激進學生特羅菲莫夫進行討論，特羅菲莫夫強調工作的重要性以及貴族適應新經濟現實的必要性。 這段對話強調了該劇的中心主題：貴族階級無法擁抱變革，需要努力工作才能進步。

The servants, Yasha and Dunyasha, provide a contrasting perspective, as they dream of a future filled with adventure and opportunity, reflecting the aspirations of the emerging middle class. Their conversations illustrate the shifting social dynamics and the desire for a life beyond the constraints of their current positions.僕人亞莎和杜尼亞莎提供了一個截然不同的視角，因為他們夢想著一個充滿冒險和機會的未來，反映了新興中產階級的願望。 他們的談話說明了社會動態的變化以及對超越當前職位限制的生活的渴望。

# The Auction and Its Implications拍賣及其影響

In the third act, the atmosphere shifts to a festive celebration in the grand ballroom, despite the impending auction of the estate. Madame Ranevskaya indulges in nostalgia, reminiscing about the past while the reality of their situation looms large. The act culminates in the announcement of the estate's sale, marking a significant turning point in the family's history. Lopakhin's acquisition of the estate symbolizes the triumph of the new social order over the old aristocracy.在第三幕中，儘管莊園即將拍賣，氣氛卻轉變為大宴會廳的節慶慶祝活動。 拉涅夫斯卡婭夫人沉迷於懷舊，追憶過去，而現實卻隱約可見。 該法案最終宣佈出售莊園，標誌著家族歷史上一個重大的轉折點。 洛帕金獲得莊園象徵新社會秩序對舊貴族統治的勝利。

Chekhov's treatment of this moment blends tragedy with comedy, as Lopakhin reflects on his rise from humble beginnings to ownership of the estate once held by his ancestors. This moment encapsulates the themes of transformation, the passage of time, and the inevitable changes in Russian society.契訶夫對這一刻的處理將悲劇與喜劇融為一體，洛帕金回顧了他從卑微的出身到擁有祖先曾經擁有的遺產的過程。 這一刻概括了轉型、時間的流逝以及俄羅斯社會不可避免的變化的主題。

# The Final Departure最後的出發

The final act takes place on a rainy day, symbolizing the somber mood as the Ranevsky family prepares to leave their home. The once vibrant nursery is now cold and empty, mirroring the family's emotional state. As they discuss their uncertain futures, the characters confront their losses and the reality of moving on. Madame Ranevskaya decides to return to Paris, while Gaev finds work as a bank clerk, and the sisters face their own paths.最後一幕發生在一個下雨天，象徵拉涅夫斯基一家準備離開家時的憂鬱情緒。 曾經充滿活力的托兒所現在變得寒冷而空曠，反映了這個家庭的情緒狀態。 當他們討論不確定的未來時，角色們面臨著他們的損失和繼續前進的現實。 拉涅夫斯卡婭夫人決定返回巴黎，而蓋夫找到了一份銀行職員的工作，姊妹倆面臨著自己的道路。

The poignant farewell scene emphasizes the bittersweet nature of change. Madame Ranevskaya's last look at the estate and her daughter's sorrow encapsulate the emotional weight of leaving behind their past. The sound of axes cutting down the cherry trees serves as a haunting reminder of the memories and heritage that are being lost.令人心酸的告別場景強調了變化的苦樂參半的本質。 拉涅夫斯卡婭夫人對莊園的最後一眼和女兒的悲傷濃縮了拋開過去的情感重擔。 斧頭砍倒櫻桃樹的聲音令人難以忘懷，提醒人們正在失去的記憶和遺產。

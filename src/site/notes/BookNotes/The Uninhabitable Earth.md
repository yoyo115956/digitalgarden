# Introduction介紹

David Wallace-Wells' book, "The Uninhabitable Earth: A Story of the Future," presents a stark and alarming vision of the future of our planet as it faces the consequences of climate change. The author argues that humanity has pushed the Earth’s climate to a breaking point, and the repercussions of our negligence are imminent. The book outlines various catastrophic scenarios that could unfold in the coming century, including freshwater scarcity, extreme weather events, and the resurgence of diseases long thought extinct. The urgency of the situation calls for immediate action to mitigate these dire predictions.大衛華萊士威爾斯的書《不適宜居住的地球：未來的故事》呈現了我們星球面臨氣候變遷後果時的嚴峻而令人震驚的未來願景。 作者認為，人類已經將地球氣候推向了臨界點，我們的疏忽所帶來的後果迫在眉睫。 這本書概述了下個世紀可能出現的各種災難性情景，包括淡水短缺、極端天氣事件以及長期被認為已經滅絕的疾病捲土重來。 情況緊迫，需要立即採取行動，以減輕這些可怕的預測。

# The Paris Climate Agreement’s Goals Are Hopelessly Optimistic《巴黎氣候協定》的目標極為樂觀

The first chapter critiques the Paris Climate Agreement, established in 2015, which aimed to limit global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Wallace-Wells argues that this goal is overly optimistic, as current trends indicate that we are likely to exceed this threshold. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that even with aggressive action, a temperature increase of 3.2 degrees Celsius is probable. This scenario would lead to catastrophic consequences, including the flooding of major cities and widespread droughts. The author emphasizes that the pace of climate change is alarming, with significant carbon emissions occurring in recent decades, and stresses the need for immediate understanding and action to address these challenges.第一章批評了 2015 年簽訂的《巴黎氣候協定》，該協定旨在將全球氣溫上升限制在比工業化前水準高 2 攝氏度以內。 華萊士-威爾斯認為，這個目標過於樂觀，因為目前的趨勢顯示我們很可能會超過這個門檻。 聯合國政府間氣候變遷專門委員會 (IPCC) 警告稱，即使採取積極行動，氣溫也可能上升 3.2 攝氏度。 這種情況將導致災難性後果，包括主要城市的洪水和大規模的乾旱。 作者強調，氣候變遷的速度令人震驚，近幾十年來出現了大量的碳排放，並強調需要立即了解並採取行動應對這些挑戰。

# The Destructive Effects of Climate Change Act as Chain Reactions氣候變遷的破壞性影響是連鎖反應

In the second chapter, Wallace-Wells discusses how the effects of climate change can trigger chain reactions, exacerbating the warming of the planet. These cascades include the melting of Arctic ice, which reduces the Earth's reflectivity and leads to further warming. The thawing of permafrost releases vast amounts of carbon and methane, potent greenhouse gases that contribute to additional warming. Wildfires, fueled by rising temperatures, also release stored carbon, creating a vicious cycle. The author highlights the complexity of these interactions and the urgent need to comprehend them to devise effective solutions.在第二章中，華萊士-威爾斯討論了氣候變遷的影響如何引發連鎖反應，加劇地球暖化。 這些瀑布包括北極冰的融化，這降低了地球的反射率並導致進一步變暖。 永久凍土的融化會釋放大量的碳和甲烷，這些強效溫室氣體會導致進一步變暖。 氣溫上升引發的野火也會釋放儲存的碳，形成惡性循環。 作者強調了這些相互作用的複雜性以及理解它們以設計有效解決方案的迫切需求。

# Severe Weather Conditions Are Becoming the New Normal惡劣天氣正成為新常態

The third chapter addresses the increasing frequency and intensity of severe weather events. As global temperatures rise, storms are becoming more common and severe, leading to significant economic damages and loss of life. The author cites examples such as Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria, which devastated Caribbean nations and Puerto Rico, respectively. The relationship between warmer air and increased moisture leads to more intense storms, and projections indicate that the frequency of severe hurricanes will continue to rise. The chapter underscores the need for preparedness as these extreme weather events become the norm.第三章討論了惡劣天氣事件的頻率和強度不斷增加的問題。 隨著全球氣溫上升，風暴變得更加普遍和嚴重，導致重大經濟損失和人員傷亡。 作者引用了颶風艾爾瑪和颶風瑪莉亞等例子，它們分別摧毀了加勒比海國家和波多黎各。 空氣變暖和濕度增加之間的關係導致更強烈的風暴，預測顯示嚴重颶風的頻率將繼續上升。 本章強調，隨著這些極端天氣事件成為常態，做好準備的必要性。

# Rising Sea Levels Will Flood Entire Cities and Countries海平面上升將淹沒整個城市和國家

In the fourth chapter, Wallace-Wells discusses the alarming rise in sea levels due to melting polar ice caps. Projections suggest that without significant emission reductions, sea levels could rise between 1.2 and 2.4 meters within the next century, threatening coastal cities and entire nations. The author warns that cities like Jakarta could be underwater by 2050, and the long-term consequences could be even more severe, with estimates of up to 6 meters of sea-level rise in the coming centuries. The chapter emphasizes the urgency of taking action to prevent these catastrophic outcomes.在第四章中，華萊士-威爾斯討論了由於極地冰蓋融化導致的海平面驚人上升。 預測表明，如果不大幅減排，海平面可能在下個世紀內上升 1.2 至 2.4 米，威脅沿海城市和整個國家。 作者警告說，到 2050 年，雅加達等城市可能會被淹沒，長期後果可能更加嚴重，預計未來幾個世紀海平面將上升 6 公尺。 本章強調採取行動防止這些災難性後果的迫切性。

# Runaway Warming Will Cause Mass Hunger and Malnourishment失控的暖化將導致大規模飢餓和營養不良

The fifth chapter explores the implications of climate change on global food security. With the world’s population expected to grow significantly by 2050, the demand for food will double, while climate change will reduce crop yields. The author highlights that for every degree of warming, cereal crop yields could decline by about 10%. This scenario poses a significant challenge, as the tropics become less hospitable for agriculture, and the nutritional value of crops diminishes due to increased carbon dioxide levels. The potential for widespread famine and malnutrition looms large, raising concerns about the future of food production.第五章探討氣候變遷對全球糧食安全的影響。 預計到 2050 年，世界人口將大幅成長，對糧食的需求將增加一倍，而氣候變遷將減少農作物產量。 作者強調，氣溫每上升一度，穀物作物產量就會下降約 10%。 這種情況帶來了重大挑戰，因為熱帶地區變得不太適合農業，而且農作物的營養價值由於二氧化碳水平的增加而降低。 大規模飢荒和營養不良的可能性日益凸顯，引發人們對糧食生產未來的擔憂。

# The Warmer It Gets, the More Disease There Will Be天氣越暖，疾病越多

In the sixth chapter, Wallace-Wells examines the health implications of climate change, particularly the resurgence of diseases. Warming temperatures create favorable conditions for the spread of infectious diseases, while ancient pathogens trapped in ice may re-emerge. The author discusses how diseases like malaria and Lyme disease could expand into new regions as climate zones shift. The potential for a global health crisis looms, as both old and new diseases threaten public health in a warming world.在第六章中，華萊士-威爾斯探討了氣候變遷對健康的影響，特別是疾病的死灰復燃。 氣溫升高為傳染病的傳播創造了有利條件，而被困在冰中的古老病原體可能會重新出現。 作者討論了瘧疾和萊姆病等疾病如何隨著氣候帶的變化而擴展到新的地區。 隨著新舊疾病在暖化的世界中威脅著公共衛生，全球健康危機的可能性迫在眉睫。

# Plummeting Air Quality Is Suffocating Us空氣品質急劇下降令我們窒息

The seventh chapter addresses the global air quality crisis exacerbated by climate change. Poor air quality is linked to numerous health issues, including respiratory diseases and mental health problems. The author notes that air pollution is responsible for millions of premature deaths each year, and the situation is expected to worsen as climate change progresses. The chapter highlights the need for urgent action to improve air quality and protect public health.第七章討論了氣候變遷加劇的全球空氣品質危機。 空氣品質差與許多健康問題有關，包括呼吸道疾病和心理健康問題。 作者指出，空氣污染每年導致數百萬人過早死亡，隨著氣候變遷的進展，情況預計會進一步惡化。 本章強調需要採取緊急行動來改善空氣品質和保護公眾健康。

# Freshwater Is Becoming an Ever More Scarce Resource淡水正成為越來越稀缺的資源

In the eighth chapter, Wallace-Wells discusses the impending freshwater crisis. Despite the abundance of water on Earth, only a small fraction is accessible for human use. Climate change is expected to exacerbate water scarcity, with demand for freshwater projected to exceed supply by 40% by 2030. The author warns that dwindling water resources could lead to conflicts over access, further complicating the challenges posed by climate change.在第八章中，華萊士-威爾斯討論了即將到來的淡水危機。 儘管地球上有豐富的水，但只有一小部分可供人類使用。 氣候變遷預計將加劇水資源短缺，預計到2030 年，淡水需求量將超過供應量的40%。 。

# Human Conflict Increases on a Hotter, Dirtier Globe地球變得更熱、更髒，人類衝突加劇

The ninth chapter explores the relationship between climate change and human conflict. Rising temperatures and resource scarcity can lead to increased violence and social unrest. The author cites studies linking higher temperatures to increased crime rates and predicts that climate-induced droughts and natural disasters will exacerbate tensions, leading to more armed conflicts. The chapter emphasizes the need to address the root causes of conflict in the context of a changing climate.第九章探討氣候變遷與人類衝突之間的關係。 氣溫上升和資源匱乏可能導致暴力和社會動盪增加。 作者引用了氣溫升高與犯罪率上升之間的關聯的研究，並預測氣候引發的乾旱和自然災害將加劇緊張局勢，導致更多武裝衝突。 本章強調需要在氣候變遷的脈絡下解決衝突的根源。

# New Technologies Give Us Ways of Softening These Disasters, but They Are Currently Impractical新技術為我們提供了減輕這些災難的方法，但目前還不切實際

In the final chapter, Wallace-Wells discusses potential technological solutions to mitigate climate change, such as negative emissions technologies. While these technologies exist, they are not yet practical on a large scale. The author emphasizes that significant investment and innovation are needed to make these solutions viable. However, the urgency of the situation means that time is running out, and immediate action is necessary to prevent further climate-related disasters.在最後一章中，華萊士-威爾斯討論了緩解氣候變遷的潛在技術解決方案，例如負排放技術。 雖然這些技術已經存在，但尚未大規模實用。 作者強調，需要大量投資和創新才能使這些解決方案可行。 然而，情況的緊迫性意味著時間已經不多了，必須立即採取行動，防止進一步的氣候相關災害。

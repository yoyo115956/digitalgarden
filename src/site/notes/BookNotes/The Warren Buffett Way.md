# A Promising Start一個充滿希望的開始

Warren Buffett's journey into investing began at the young age of 11 when he made his first stock purchase with savings from various entrepreneurial activities. His initial experience taught him valuable lessons about market fluctuations and the importance of holding onto investments for substantial profits rather than succumbing to panic. After graduating from college, Buffett gained practical experience at Graham Newman Corporation, where he learned the fundamentals of trading. By 25, he had established his first limited liability partnership, achieving impressive returns that significantly outperformed the market. His acquisition of Berkshire Hathaway in 1965 marked a pivotal moment, transitioning the company from textiles to a diversified investment powerhouse. Buffett's ability to adapt and make strategic decisions laid the groundwork for his future success.華倫巴菲特的投資之旅始於 11 歲，當時他用各種創業活動的積蓄首次購買了股票。 他最初的經歷教會了他關於市場波動的寶貴教訓，以及堅持投資以獲得豐厚利潤而不是屈服於恐慌的重要性。 大學畢業後，巴菲特在格雷厄姆紐曼公司獲得了實踐經驗，在那裡他學習了交易的基礎知識。 25 歲時，他建立了第一個有限責任合夥企業，取得了顯著優於市場的可觀回報。 1965 年，他對波克夏海瑟威的收購標誌著一個關鍵時刻，使該公司從紡織業轉型為多元化投資巨頭。 巴菲特的適應能力和戰略決策能力為他未來的成功奠定了基礎。

# A Good Education良好的教育

Buffett's investment philosophy was shaped by influential figures such as Benjamin Graham and Philip Fisher. Graham, known for his principle of "don't lose," emphasized thorough research and identifying undervalued companies. Fisher, on the other hand, focused on investing in quality businesses with strong management. Buffett's partnership with Charlie Munger further enriched his investment approach, leading to significant acquisitions like C's Candies, which exemplified the importance of quality over bargain pricing. This blend of Graham's and Fisher's philosophies became integral to Buffett's investment strategy.巴菲特的投資理念是由本傑明·格雷厄姆和菲利普·費雪等有影響力的人物塑造的。 格雷厄姆以其“不輸”原則而聞名，他強調徹底研究和識別被低估的公司。 另一方面，費雪專注於投資具有強大管理能力的優質企業。 巴菲特與查理·芒格的合作進一步豐富了他的投資方式，促成了像 C's Candies 這樣的重大收購，這體現了質量比討價還價的重要性。 格雷厄姆和費雪哲學的這種融合成為巴菲特投資策略不可或缺的一部分。

# The Buffett Buying Guide巴菲特購買指南

Buffett's investment decisions are guided by a set of twelve tenets that encompass both business characteristics and management qualities. He emphasizes investing within one's circle of competence, seeking businesses that are simple to understand and have a consistent operating history. Evaluating management involves assessing financial prudence, honesty, and the ability to resist herd mentality. Financial metrics such as return on equity and profit margins play a crucial role in his analysis, along with considerations of intrinsic value and market price. Ultimately, Buffett aims to acquire companies with strong fundamentals and ethical management, setting the stage for long-term growth.巴菲特的投資決策遵循十二項原則，涵蓋業務特徵和管理素質。 他強調在自己的能力範圍內進行投資，尋找易於理解且具有一致經營歷史的企業。 評估管理涉及評估財務審慎、誠實和抵制從眾心理的能力。 股本回報率和利潤率等財務指標以及內在價值和市場價格的考慮因素在他的分析中發揮著至關重要的作用。 最終，巴菲特的目標是收購具有強大基礎和道德管理的公司，為長期成長奠定基礎。

# Meet Mr. Market認識市場先生

Buffett's approach to investing is also influenced by psychological factors, illustrated through the metaphor of "Mr. Market." This concept, introduced by Graham, highlights the emotional volatility of the market and the importance of maintaining a rational perspective. Behavioral finance identifies common psychological traps that can lead investors astray, such as overconfidence, loss aversion, and the tendency to follow the crowd. Understanding these biases is essential for making informed investment decisions and avoiding impulsive reactions to market fluctuations.巴菲特的投資方式也受到心理因素的影響，可以透過「市場先生」的比喻來說明。 葛拉漢提出的這個概念凸顯了市場情緒的波動以及保持理性觀點的重要性。 行為金融學識別了可能導致投資者誤入歧途的常見心理陷阱，例如過度自信、厭惡損失和隨波逐流的傾向。 了解這些偏見對於做出明智的投資決策和避免對市場波動的衝動反應至關重要。

# Patience and Rationality耐心與理性

Buffett's success is largely attributed to his patience and rational thinking, which contrast sharply with the short-term mindset prevalent among many investors. Research indicates that long-term investments yield significantly higher returns, yet the majority of market activity is driven by immediate reactions. Buffett advocates for a disciplined approach, employing System 2 thinking—characterized by careful analysis and reflection—rather than the instinctual System 1 thinking that often leads to errors. This commitment to thorough research and long-term perspective enables Buffett to navigate market volatility and capitalize on opportunities that others may overlook.巴菲特的成功很大程度上歸功於他的耐心和理性思維，這與許多投資者普遍存在的短期思維形成鮮明對比。 研究表明，長期投資的回報率明顯更高，但大多數市場活動都是由即時反應驅動的。 巴菲特主張採取有紀律的方法，採用以仔細分析和反思為特徵的系統 2 思維，而不是經常導致錯誤的本能係統 1 思維。 這種對徹底研究和長遠眼光的承諾使巴菲特能夠駕馭市場波動並利用其他人可能忽視的機會。

# Introduction介紹

Ron Chernow's biography "Alexander Hamilton" presents a comprehensive exploration of Hamilton's vital role in American history, emphasizing his contributions to independence and the establishment of the United States. Often overshadowed by figures like Thomas Jefferson, Hamilton's legacy as a soldier, aide to George Washington, author of the Federalist Papers, and founder of the first central bank is pivotal in shaping the nation. Chernow examines Hamilton's challenging upbringing in the Caribbean, his political and military career, tumultuous love life, and enduring influence on modern America, portraying him as a complex and significant figure.羅恩·切爾諾的傳記《亞歷山大·漢密爾頓》全面探討了漢密爾頓在美國歷史上的重要作用，強調了他對美國獨立和建立的貢獻。 漢密爾頓作為一名軍人、喬治華盛頓的助手、《聯邦黨人文集》的作者以及第一家中央銀行的創始人，常常被托馬斯·傑斐遜等人物所掩蓋，但他的遺產對於塑造國家至關重要。 切爾諾審視了漢密爾頓在加勒比海充滿挑戰的成長經歷、他的政治和軍事生涯、動蕩的愛情生活以及對現代美國的持久影響，將他描繪成一個複雜而重要的人物。

# Chapter 1: Early Life第一章：早年生活

Hamilton's life began on the Caribbean island of Nevis, born to an unmarried mother. His father abandoned the family when Hamilton was eleven, leaving him and his brother orphaned. Despite these hardships, Hamilton's passion for reading and learning led him to work as a clerk at a trading firm in New York. This position allowed him to gain knowledge about trade policy and international relations. In 1772, he wrote a poignant letter about a hurricane in St. Croix, which was published by Henry Knox to showcase his talents and raise funds for his education. This support enabled Hamilton to move to the American colonies, where he would eventually become a founding father.漢彌爾頓的生活始於加勒比海的尼維斯島，母親為未婚人士。 當漢密爾頓十一歲時，他的父親拋棄了家庭，使他和他的兄弟成為孤兒。 儘管困難重重，漢密爾頓對閱讀和學習的熱情促使他在紐約一家貿易公司擔任職員。 這個職位使他獲得了有關貿易政策和國際關係的知識。 1772 年，他寫了一封關於聖克羅伊颶風的令人心酸的信，由亨利·諾克斯出版，以展示他的才華並為他的教育籌集資金。 這種支持使漢密爾頓得以移居美洲殖民地，並最終成為那裡的開國元勳。

# Chapter 2: Revolutionary Spirit第2章 革命精神

Upon arriving in Boston in 1772, Hamilton found the colonies on the brink of revolution. His studies at King's College were overshadowed by the growing tensions with Britain, particularly after the Boston Tea Party in 1773. Hamilton joined the protest, delivering speeches in support of boycotting British goods, which elevated his status in the independence movement. He engaged in a pamphlet war with Anglican cleric Samuel Seabury, showcasing his persuasive writing skills. The conflict escalated into military action, with Hamilton's involvement laying the groundwork for his future contributions to American history.1772 年抵達波士頓後，漢密爾頓發現殖民地正處於革命的邊緣。 他在國王學院的學業因與英國日益緊張的關係而蒙上陰影，特別是在1773 年波士頓茶黨之後。地位。 他與聖公會牧師塞繆爾·西伯里展開了一場小冊子大戰，展示了他有說服力的寫作技巧。 衝突升級為軍事行動，漢密爾頓的參與為他未來對美國歷史的貢獻奠定了基礎。

# Chapter 3: Military Service第三章：服兵役

Hamilton's talents caught the attention of George Washington, who appointed him as his aide-de-camp. Eager to prove himself in battle, Hamilton joined a New York militia and quickly distinguished himself during an artillery operation in 1775. By 1776, he was promoted to aide-de-camp, where he played a crucial role in Washington's correspondence and military strategy. His friendship with John Lawrence, an abolitionist, further enriched his experience during the war. Hamilton's ambition drove him to seek a command position, which he achieved during the decisive battle at Yorktown in 1781, solidifying his reputation as a revolutionary hero.漢密爾頓的才華引起了喬治華盛頓的注意，華盛頓任命他為副官。 渴望在戰鬥中證明自己的漢密爾頓加入了紐約民兵，並在 1775 年的一次砲擊行動中迅速嶄露頭角。 他與廢奴主義者約翰·勞倫斯的友誼進一步豐富了他在戰爭期間的經歷。 漢密爾頓的野心促使他尋求指揮職位，並在 1781 年約克鎮的決戰中獲得了這一職位，鞏固了他作為革命英雄的聲譽。

# Chapter 4: Post-War Politics第四章：戰後政治

After the war, Hamilton returned to public life, joining the Continental Congress. He became a citizen of New York and completed his legal studies, passing the bar in six months. Hamilton's writings, including the Continentalist essays, impressed legislators and led to his appointment as a delegate to the Continental Congress. He recognized the need for a strong central government to address the challenges facing the newly independent states, including debt and unrest among soldiers. His practical approach culminated in the establishment of the Bank of New York in 1784, which provided necessary credit.戰後，漢密爾頓重返公共生活，加入了大陸會議。 他成為紐約公民並完成了法律學習，並在六個月內通過了律師資格考試。 漢密爾頓的著作，包括大陸主義者的文章，給立法者留下了深刻的印象，並導致他被任命為大陸會議代表。 他認識到需要一個強大的中央政府來解決新獨立國家面臨的挑戰，包括債務和士兵騷亂。 他的務實做法最終於 1784 年成立了紐約銀行，提供了必要的信貸。

# Chapter 5: Constitutional Convention第五章 制憲會議

Hamilton played a crucial role in the Constitutional Convention of 1787, advocating for a powerful central government. His six-hour speech laid out a vision for a centralized executive and Senate, which helped break the gridlock at the Convention. As one of the five members of the committee tasked with drafting the Constitution, Hamilton became the only New York delegate to sign it. To ensure its ratification, he collaborated with Madison and John Jay to write the Federalist Papers, a series of essays defending the Constitution and its principles.漢密爾頓在 1787 年制憲會議上發揮了至關重要的作用，主張建立一個強大的中央政府。 他在六小時的演講中提出了集中行政和參議院的願景，這有助於打破大會的僵局。 作為負責起草憲法的委員會的五名成員之一，漢密爾頓成為唯一簽署憲法的紐約代表。 為了確保憲法獲得批准，他與麥迪遜和約翰·傑伊合作撰寫了《聯邦黨人文集》，這是一系列捍衛憲法及其原則的文章。

# Chapter 6: Secretary of the Treasury第六章：財政部長

With the establishment of the United States, Hamilton became the first Secretary of the Treasury under President Washington. His work ethic and vision for a strong federal government set him apart from his cabinet colleagues. Hamilton faced the daunting task of addressing the national debt and establishing a stable financial system. He proposed that the federal government assume state debts, a plan that faced opposition, particularly from Jefferson and Madison, who believed it unfairly burdened states like Virginia that had already paid off their debts.隨著美國的建立，漢密爾頓成為華盛頓總統領導下的第一位財政部長。 他的職業道德和對強大聯邦政府的願景使他有別於他的內閣同事。 漢密爾頓面臨著解決國家債務和建立穩定的金融體系的艱鉅任務。 他提議聯邦政府承擔州債務，這一計劃遭到了反對，尤其是傑斐遜和麥迪遜的反對，他們認為這給弗吉尼亞州等已經還清債務的州帶來了不公平的負擔。

# Chapter 7: Economic Policies第七章：經濟政策

Hamilton's economic policies, including the establishment of a national coast guard and the first central bank, were designed to stabilize the nation's finances. He recognized the need for new revenue sources and implemented a tax on imported goods. The creation of the central bank in 1791 allowed for a national currency and facilitated credit, despite opposition from Jefferson and Madison. Hamilton's vision for a commercial economy clashed with the agrarian ideals of his rivals, leading to further political divisions.漢密爾頓的經濟政策，包括建立國家海岸警衛隊和第一家中央銀行，旨在穩定國家財政。 他認識到需要新的收入來源，並對進口商品徵稅。 儘管遭到傑佛遜和麥迪遜的反對，1791 年中央銀行的成立允許本國貨幣並促進信貸。 漢密爾頓的商業經濟願景與其競爭對手的農業理想發生衝突，導致進一步的政治分歧。

# Chapter 8: Political Rivalries第8章：政治對抗

As Hamilton's influence grew, so did his political rivalries, particularly with Jefferson. Their disagreements over foreign policy during the war between Britain and France further polarized the cabinet, leading to the formation of the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties. Hamilton's support for neutrality in the conflict contrasted with Jefferson's inclination to support France, deepening the ideological divide. The departure of Washington from the presidency marked a turning point, with Hamilton increasingly isolated as political tensions escalated.隨著漢密爾頓影響力的成長，他的政治競爭也隨之加劇，尤其是與傑佛遜的競爭。 在英法戰爭期間，他們在外交政策上的分歧進一步導致內閣兩極化，導致聯邦黨和民主共和黨的形成。 漢密爾頓在衝突中支持中立，與傑佛遜支持法國的傾向形成鮮明對比，從而加深了意識形態分歧。 華盛頓卸任總統標誌著一個轉捩點，隨著政治緊張局勢升級，漢密爾頓日益孤立。

# Chapter 9: Scandal and Redemption第9章：醜聞與救贖

Hamilton faced personal scandal when his affair with Maria Reynolds became public in 1797. The ensuing blackmail and public humiliation damaged his reputation, but he managed to regain some political footing during the Quasi-War with France. His pamphlets criticizing Jefferson's faction helped galvanize support for a provisional army, leading to his reappointment in a military role alongside Washington. This period marked a temporary resurgence in Hamilton's political influence.1797 年，漢密爾頓與瑪麗亞·雷諾茲的戀情曝光後，他面臨著個人醜聞。地位。 他批評傑斐遜派系的小冊子幫助激發了對臨時軍隊的支持，導致他再次被任命與華盛頓一起擔任軍事職位。 這段時期標誌著漢密爾頓政治影響力的暫時復甦。

# Chapter 10: The Election of 1800第10章：1800年的選舉

The presidential election of 1800 saw Hamilton's conflicts with both Adams and Jefferson come to a head. His attempts to undermine Adams in favor of a Federalist candidate backfired, leading to a Democratic-Republican victory. Hamilton's actions alienated former allies and left him politically vulnerable. The election resulted in a tie between Jefferson and Aaron Burr, forcing Hamilton to choose between the two. He ultimately supported Jefferson, viewing Burr as an opportunist.1800 年的總統選舉使漢密爾頓與亞當斯和傑斐遜的衝突達到了白熱化。 他試圖削弱亞當斯以支持聯邦黨候選人，但結果適得其反，導致民主共和黨取得勝利。 漢密爾頓的行為疏遠了前盟友，並使他在政治上處於弱勢。 選舉結果是傑斐遜和亞倫·伯爾打成平手，迫使漢密爾頓在兩人之間做出選擇。 他最終支持傑斐遜，並將伯爾視為機會主義者。

# Chapter 11: Personal Tragedy第11章：個人悲劇

Hamilton's personal life faced tragedy when his son Philip was killed in a duel in 1801. The loss deeply affected Hamilton and his family, compounding the isolation he felt in the political arena.

Despite Hamilton's intention to fire into the air, Burr's shot struck him, leading to his death the following day. The public reaction to Hamilton's death was profound, with many mourning the loss of a key architect of the nation.1804 年，漢密爾頓和伯爾之間的競爭在一場致命的決鬥中達到了頂峰。 儘管漢密爾頓打算向空中開槍，但伯爾的子彈擊中了他，導致他第二天死亡。 公眾對漢密爾頓的去世反應深刻，許多人哀悼這位國家重要建築師的去世。

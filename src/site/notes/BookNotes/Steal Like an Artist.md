# Introduction to Creativity and Influence創造力和影響力簡介

The essence of creativity is often misunderstood, with many believing that originality is the hallmark of great art. However, Austin Kleon, in his book "Steal Like an Artist," argues that every artist is influenced by the works of those who came before them. This concept challenges the notion of originality, suggesting that true creativity is about building upon existing ideas rather than creating something entirely new. The idea that "every great artist is a thief" emphasizes the importance of drawing inspiration from artistic legacies.創造力的本質經常被誤解，許多人認為原創性是偉大藝術的標誌。 然而，奧斯汀·克萊恩（Austin Kleon）在他的《像藝術家一樣偷竊》一書中認為，每個藝術家都會受到前人作品的影響。 這個概念挑戰了原創性的概念，表明真正的創造力是建立在現有想法的基礎上，而不是創造全新的東西。 「每個偉大的藝術家都是小偷」的觀念強調了從藝術遺產中汲取靈感的重要性。

# The Nature of Originality原創性的本質

Kleon asserts that there is no such thing as completely original art. Artists like Picasso and Dali were not immune to influence; rather, they were products of their artistic environments. The Beatles, for instance, began as a cover band, honing their skills by imitating their musical heroes before developing their unique sound. This process of artistic influence can be likened to genetics, where artists are a blend of their predecessors' ideas. To cultivate creativity, one should create an "artistic family tree," identifying and immersing oneself in the works of admired artists, thereby expanding one's creative horizons.克萊昂斷言，不存在完全原創的藝術。 像畢卡索和達利這樣的藝術家也未能倖免於影響。 相反，它們是其藝術環境的產物。 例如，披頭四最初是一支翻唱樂隊，透過模仿他們的音樂英雄來磨練他們的技能，然後發展出他們獨特的聲音。 這種藝術影響的過程可以比喻為遺傳學，藝術家是前輩思想的融合。 為了培養創造力，人們應該創造一個“藝術家譜”，識別並沉浸在受人尊敬的藝術家的作品中，從而擴大自己的創作視野。

# Imitation and Emulation模仿與仿真

The journey of an artist often begins with imitation. Kleon encourages aspiring creatives to start by mimicking their heroes, not just in style but in lifestyle and motivation. Through this process, artists will naturally discover their unique voice and niche. Emulation, the next step, involves recognizing one's differences from their idols and leveraging those to carve out a distinct artistic identity. This evolution from imitation to emulation is crucial for personal growth and innovation in art.藝術家的旅程往往是從模仿開始的。 克萊昂鼓勵有抱負的創意者從模仿他們的英雄開始，不僅在風格上，而且在生活方式和動機上。 透過這個過程，藝術家自然會發現自己獨特的聲音和定位。 下一步是模仿，包括認識到自己與偶像的差異，並利用這些差異來塑造獨特的藝術身份。 這種從模仿到模仿的演變對於個人成長和藝術創新至關重要。

# Maintaining Hobbies and Side Projects保持愛好和副業

As artists focus on their primary creative endeavors, there is a temptation to abandon hobbies and side projects. However, Kleon warns against this, emphasizing that such activities can provide necessary mental breaks and outlets during creative blocks. Engaging in diverse interests fosters creativity and prevents burnout. The author shares his experience of returning to playing guitar, which rejuvenated his artistic spirit and improved his overall work.當藝術家專注於他們的主要創作活動時，他們很容易放棄愛好和副業。 然而，克萊昂對此提出警告，強調此類活動可以在創意停滯期間提供必要的精神休息和發洩。 從事不同的興趣可以培養創造力並防止倦怠。 作者分享了他重新開始彈吉他的經歷，這讓他的藝術精神煥發了活力，也提高了他的整體作品。

# The Value of Obscurity默默無聞的價值

In the pursuit of fame, many artists overlook the benefits of obscurity. Kleon suggests that being unknown allows for experimentation and the freedom to make mistakes without the pressure of public scrutiny. This phase is essential for growth and exploration. Once an artist has developed their craft, sharing their work becomes vital. The internet provides a platform for artists to showcase their creations, connect with audiences, and build a following.在追求名氣的過程中，許多藝術家忽略了默默無聞的好處。 克萊昂認為，不為人知可以進行實驗，可以自由地犯錯，而無需受到公眾監督的壓力。 這個階段對於成長和探索至關重要。 一旦藝術家發展了自己的技藝，分享他們的作品就變得至關重要。 網路為藝術家提供了一個展示其創作、與觀眾聯繫並建立追隨者的平台。

# Creating an Inspiring Workspace創造一個鼓舞人心的工作空間

An artist's environment plays a significant role in their creative process. Kleon advises creating a workspace that inspires and caters to various aspects of creativity. While technology is a valuable tool, hands-on activities like sketching and model-making can spark new ideas. Additionally, stepping outside one’s usual surroundings can provide fresh perspectives and inspiration, as the author experienced during his time living abroad.藝術家的環境在他們的創作過程中扮演著重要角色。 克萊昂建議創造一個能夠激發和滿足創造力各個層面的工作空間。 雖然技術是一種有價值的工具，但素描和模型製作等實作活動可以激發新的想法。 此外，正如作者在國外生活期間所經歷的那樣，走出平常的環境可以提供新的視角和靈感。

# Handling Praise and Criticism處理讚美和批評

In the digital age, artists must navigate both praise and criticism. Kleon encourages artists to value positive feedback while not allowing negative comments to deter their creativity. Engaging with criticism can be counterproductive; instead, artists should focus on constructive uses of their emotions, such as channeling anger into creativity. Maintaining a "praise file" can serve as a reminder of one’s impact and encourage continued artistic endeavors.處理讚揚和批評在數位時代，藝術家必須應對讚揚和批評。 克萊昂鼓勵藝術家重視正面的回饋，同時不允許負面評論阻礙他們的創造力。 參與批評可能適得其反； 相反，藝術家應該專注於對自己情感的建設性運用，例如將憤怒轉化為創造力。 維護「表揚檔案」可以提醒人們的影響並鼓勵持續的藝術努力。

# Conclusion: Embracing the Artistic Journey結論：擁抱藝術之旅

The key takeaway from Kleon's work is that all art is influenced by prior works, and artists should embrace this reality. By learning from idols, maintaining a balance between work and leisure, and sharing their creations, artists can cultivate their unique voices. The journey involves exploration, experimentation, and the courage to step outside comfort zones. Ultimately, this approach leads to the creation of art that resonates with others and contributes to the ongoing legacy of creativity.克萊昂作品的關鍵要點是，所有藝術都受到先前作品的影響，藝術家應該接受這個現實。 透過向偶像學習、平衡工作與休閒、分享創作，藝術家可以培養自己獨特的聲音。 這趟旅程涉及探索、實驗和走出舒適圈的勇氣。 最終，這種方法會帶來與他人產生共鳴的藝術創作，並為持續的創造力遺產做出貢獻。

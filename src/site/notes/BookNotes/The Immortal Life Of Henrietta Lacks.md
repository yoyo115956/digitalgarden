# Introduction介紹

The story of Henrietta Lacks, the woman behind the immortal HeLa cells, is a profound narrative that intertwines medical history, ethics, and the legacy of racial injustice in America. In "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks," Rebecca Skloot explores both Henrietta's life and the scientific significance of her cells, which have contributed to numerous medical breakthroughs. Despite the monumental impact of her cells, Henrietta's identity remained largely unknown until recent years, highlighting the often-overlooked contributions of Black individuals in the medical field.不朽海拉細胞背後的女性亨麗埃塔·拉克斯的故事是一個深刻的故事，將醫學史、倫理學和美國種族不平等的遺產交織在一起。 在《亨利埃塔的不朽生命》一書中，麗貝卡·斯克洛特探索了亨利埃塔的生命和她的細胞的科學意義，這些細胞為許多醫學突破做出了貢獻。 儘管亨麗埃塔的細胞產生了巨大的影響，但直到最近幾年，她的身份仍然很大程度上不為人所知，這突顯了黑人在醫學領域經常被忽視的貢獻。

# Henrietta Lacks: A Life of Struggle亨麗埃塔缺乏：奮鬥的一生

Henrietta Lacks was born on August 1, 1920, in Roanoke, Virginia, into a poor Black family. She spent her childhood working on her family's tobacco farm and later married her cousin, David Lacks. The couple faced financial hardships, prompting them to move to Sparrows Point, Maryland, in search of better opportunities. In 1951, Henrietta visited the Johns Hopkins Gynecology Center, where she discovered a lump on her cervix. After undergoing a biopsy, she was diagnosed with stage 1 epidermoid carcinoma of the cervix. Despite receiving treatment involving radium, which caused severe burns, Henrietta ultimately succumbed to her illness on October 4, 1951.亨麗埃塔·拉克斯 (Henrietta Lacks) 1920 年 8 月 1 日出生於維吉尼亞州羅阿諾克的一個貧窮的黑人家庭。 她的童年在自家的菸草農場裡度過，後來嫁給了她的表弟大衛·拉克斯(David Lacks)。 這對夫婦面臨經濟困難，促使他們搬到馬裡蘭州麻雀角尋找更好的機會。 1951 年，亨利埃塔 (Henrietta) 參觀了約翰霍普金斯大學婦科中心，在那裡她發現她的子宮頸上有一個腫塊。 接受切片檢查後，她被診斷出患有1期子宮頸表皮樣癌。 儘管接受了鐳治療，導致嚴重燒傷，亨利埃塔最終還是在 1951 年 10 月 4 日因病去世。

# The Birth of HeLa Cells海拉細胞的誕生

While Henrietta's life ended, her cells, known as HeLa cells, continued to thrive. Scientists in the early 1950s were struggling to keep human cells alive outside the body for research purposes. George Guy, head of tissue culture research at Johns Hopkins, developed a revolutionary roller tube culturing technique that allowed cells to survive and multiply. When HeLa cells were extracted from Henrietta, they not only survived but proliferated at an unprecedented rate, doubling every 24 hours. This remarkable resilience made HeLa cells invaluable for research into various diseases, including polio and cancer.當亨利埃塔的生命結束時，她的細胞，即海拉細胞，繼續茁壯成長。 20 世紀 50 年代初，科學家們為了研究目的而努力讓人體細胞在體外存活。 約翰霍普金斯大學組織培養研究負責人喬治蓋伊開發了一種革命性的滾管培養技術，使細胞能夠存活和繁殖。 當從 Henrietta 身上提取 HeLa 細胞時，它們不僅存活下來，而且以前所未有的速度增殖，每 24 小時增加一倍。 這種非凡的恢復能力使 HeLa 細胞對於研究各種疾病（包括小兒麻痺和癌症）具有不可估量的價值。

# Mass Production of HeLa Cells海拉細胞的量產

Following Henrietta's death, scientists established a factory to mass-produce HeLa cells, primarily to combat polio. The cells were cost-effective, resilient, and could be transported easily, making them ideal for research. The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis set up the HeLa Distribution Center to facilitate the growth and distribution of these cells, which soon became essential for a wide range of medical research.亨利埃塔去世後，科學家建立了一家工廠大規模生產海拉細胞，主要用於對抗小兒麻痺。 這些細胞具有成本效益、有彈性，並且可以輕鬆運輸，使其成為研究的理想選擇。 國家小兒麻痺基金會設立了 HeLa 分配中心，以促進這些細胞的生長和分配，這很快就成為廣泛的醫學研究所必需的。

# The Forgotten Legacy of Henrietta Lacks亨利埃塔被遺忘的遺產缺乏

Despite the global spread of HeLa cells, Henrietta and her family remained largely forgotten. The Lacks family was unaware of the significance of Henrietta's cells and the extent to which they were being used in research. The author, Rebecca Skloot, faced challenges in her quest to uncover Henrietta's story, as the family was reluctant to engage with outsiders due to a history of exploitation and mistrust of the medical community. This distrust was rooted in historical injustices, such as the Tuskegee syphilis study, which had exploited Black individuals for research without their consent.儘管海拉細胞在全球範圍內傳播，但亨利埃塔和她的家人仍然基本上被遺忘。 拉克斯家族並不知道亨利埃塔細胞的重要性以及它們在研究中的使用程度。 作者 Rebecca Skloot 在揭開亨利埃塔故事的過程中面臨挑戰，因為該家族由於歷史上受剝削和對醫學界的不信任而不願與外人接觸。 這種不信任源自於歷史上的不公現象，例如塔斯基吉梅毒研究，該研究未經黑人同意就利用黑人進行研究。

# Struggles of the Lacks Family缺乏家族的掙扎

After Henrietta's death, her family faced significant financial difficulties. Day Lacks, her husband, worked multiple jobs to support their children, who were left to navigate their grief and confusion about their mother's absence. The children were instructed not to ask questions about their mother, leading to a lack of understanding about her life and contributions. It wasn't until years later that Deborah, one of Henrietta's daughters, began to seek answers about her mother, prompting a journey of discovery for both the family and the author.亨利埃塔去世後，她的家人面臨嚴重的經濟困境。 她的丈夫戴·拉克斯 (Day Lacks) 打了幾份工作來養活孩子，孩子們只能獨自應對母親缺席帶來的悲傷和困惑。 孩子們被告知不要問有關母親的問題，導致對她的生活和貢獻缺乏了解。 直到幾年後，亨利埃塔的女兒黛博拉開始尋找有關她母親的答案，這引發了家人和作者的發現之旅。

# Historical Distrust of the Medical Profession歷史上對醫療產業的不信任

The Lacks family's reluctance to engage with the medical community stemmed from a long history of exploitation of Black Americans in medical research. Stories of "night doctors" who abducted Black individuals for experimentation contributed to a deep-seated fear and mistrust of medical professionals. This historical context shaped the family's interactions with researchers and highlighted the ethical implications of using Henrietta's cells without her consent.拉克斯家族不願與醫學界接觸，源自於美國黑人在醫學研究中長期受到剝削的歷史。 「夜間醫生」綁架黑人進行實驗的故事加劇了對醫療專業人員根深蒂固的恐懼和不信任。 這種歷史背景塑造了該家庭與研究人員的互動，並強調了未經亨麗埃塔同意而使用她的細胞的倫理影響。

# Contamination and Ethical Concerns污染和道德問題

As HeLa cells became widely used in research, concerns arose about contamination. Geneticist Stanley Gartler discovered that HeLa cells had contaminated many other cell cultures, undermining the validity of numerous studies. This revelation prompted scientists to seek out Henrietta's family for blood samples, hoping to understand the extent of the contamination and its implications for genetic research. Deborah Lacks, concerned about her own health, became increasingly involved in discussions about her mother's legacy and the use of her cells.隨著 HeLa 細胞在研究中廣泛使用，人們開始擔心污染問題。 遺傳學家 Stanley Gartler 發現 HeLa 細胞污染了許多其他細胞培養物，破壞了許多研究的有效性。 這項發現促使科學家向亨利埃塔的家人尋找血液樣本，希望能了解污染的程度及其對基因研究的影響。 黛博拉·拉克斯擔心自己的健康，越來越多地參與有關她母親的遺產和她的細胞的使用的討論。

# The Broader Implications of Cell Donation細胞捐贈的更廣泛影響

The case of Henrietta Lacks raises important questions about the ethics of cell donation and the rights of patients. While Henrietta's situation was unique, it reflects broader issues in medical research regarding consent and ownership of biological materials. Other cases, such as those of John Moore and Ted Slavin, illustrate the complexities surrounding the commercialization of human cells and the need for informed consent.細胞捐贈的更廣泛影響 Henrietta Lacks 的案例提出了有關細胞捐贈的倫理和患者權利的重要問題。 雖然亨利埃塔的情況很獨特，但它反映了醫學研究中有關生物材料的同意和所有權的更廣泛問題。 其他案例，例如約翰·摩爾和泰德·斯拉文的案例，說明了人類細胞商業化的複雜性以及知情同意的必要性。

# The Future of Medical Research and Patient Rights醫學研究和病人權利的未來

The HeLa case has significant implications for the future of medical research and patient rights. While current regulations require consent for the use of tissue samples, there are still gaps in oversight regarding the storage and commercialization of cells. The debate continues over whether patients should have the right to know how their cells will be used and whether they should benefit financially from their contributions to research.海拉案對醫學研究的未來和病人權利有重大影響。 儘管現行法規要求使用組織樣本需獲得同意，但在細胞儲存和商業化方面的監管仍存在差距。 關於患者是否應該有權知道他們的細胞將如何使用以及他們是否應該從他們對研究的貢獻中獲得經濟利益的爭論仍在繼續。

# Conclusion結論

Henrietta Lacks's story is a powerful reminder of the intersection of race, ethics, and medical research. Her cells have played a crucial role in advancing science, yet her identity and contributions were largely overlooked for decades. "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks" not only honors her legacy but also prompts critical discussions about consent, exploitation, and the rights of individuals in the realm of medical research. As we reflect on Henrietta's life and the impact of her cells, it is essential to acknowledge the ethical responsibilities that come with scientific advancement and the importance of recognizing the humanity behind medical breakthroughs.亨麗埃塔·拉克斯的故事有力地提醒人們種族、倫理和醫學研究的交叉點。 她的細胞在推動科學發展方面發揮了至關重要的作用，但幾十年來她的身份和貢獻在很大程度上被忽視了。 《亨利埃塔·缺乏的不朽生命》不僅向她的遺產致敬，也引發了關於醫學研究領域的同意、剝削和個人權利的批判性討論。 當我們反思亨利埃塔的生活和她的細胞的影響時，必須承認科學進步所帶來的道德責任，以及認識到醫學突破背後的人性的重要性。

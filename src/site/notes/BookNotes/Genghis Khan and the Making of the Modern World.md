# Introduction介紹

Genghis Khan is often portrayed as a brutal conqueror responsible for the destruction of civilizations. However, this characterization raises questions about the complexity of his legacy. Was he a unifier or a destroyer? Did he rise to greatness through privilege or struggle? This biography explores the life of Genghis Khan, revealing the nuances of his character and the impact of his actions.成吉思汗經常被描繪成一個殘酷的征服者，對文明的毀滅負有責任。 然而，這種描述引發了人們對他遺產的複雜性的質疑。 他是統一者還是破壞者？ 他是透過特權還是奮鬥而變得偉大的？ 這本傳記探討了成吉思汗的一生，揭示了他性格的細微差別以及他的行為的影響。

# Early Life and Influences早年生活和影響

The story begins with a young girl named Holun, who, along with her husband Kiledu, is pursued by horsemen from a rival tribe. To save her husband, Holun decides to surrender and is subsequently kidnapped. She becomes the wife of Yesugai, who later fathers a son named Temüjin, known to history as Genghis Khan. Temüjin's early life is marked by hardship; after his father's death, his family is abandoned by their clan and left to fend for themselves. Holun's determination and resourcefulness enable them to survive in the harsh steppes.故事開始於一個名叫霍倫的年輕女孩，她和她的丈夫基勒杜被敵對部落的騎兵追趕。 為了拯救丈夫，霍倫決定投降，隨後被綁架。 她成為也速該的妻子，也速該後來生了一個兒子，名叫鐵木真，史稱成吉思汗。 鐵木真的早年生活充滿艱辛。 父親過世後，他的家人被家族拋棄，只能自力更生。 霍倫的決心和足智多謀使他們能夠在嚴酷的草原上生存。

Temüjin's formative experiences shape his worldview. Witnessing the murder of an old man who defended his family instills in him the belief that a person's worth is determined by their actions, not their social status. The dynamics within his family, particularly with his half-brother Vegta, further influence his character. A violent confrontation with Vegta leads Temüjin and his brother Khazar to become outcasts, setting the stage for Temüjin's future as a leader willing to defy tradition.鐵木真的成長經歷塑造了他的世界觀。 目睹一位捍衛家人的老人被謀殺，讓他相信一個人的價值取決於他們的行為，而不是他們的社會地位。 他的家庭內部的動態，特別是與他同父異母的兄弟貝格塔的動態，進一步影響了他的性格。 與貝蓋塔的暴力對抗導致鐵木真和他的兄弟可札爾成為被排斥者，這為鐵木真未來成為願意反抗傳統的領導者奠定了基礎。

# Rise to Power掌權

As Temüjin matures, he forms a bond with his childhood friend Yamuka, pledging brotherhood. However, as their relationship evolves, Temüjin grows resentful of Yamuka's dominance. Following a significant insult, Temüjin decides to break away and establish his own following, igniting a rivalry that lasts for decades. In 1189, Temüjin claims the title of Khan, marking a pivotal moment in his quest for power.隨著鐵木真的成熟，他與兒時的好友雅木卡結下了深厚的兄弟情誼。 然而，隨著他們關係的發展，鐵木真對亞木卡的統治越來越不滿。 在遭受重大侮辱後，鐵木真決定脫離並建立自己的追隨者，引發了一場持續數十年的競爭。 1189 年，鐵木真自稱可汗，這是他追求權力的關鍵時刻。

Temüjin's leadership style is revolutionary for the time. He appoints leaders based on merit rather than kinship, fostering loyalty among his followers. He implements military strategies that ensure complete victories over defeated clans, redistributing loot fairly among his warriors. His reforms promote unity among the Mongol tribes, encouraging intermarriage and establishing a sense of camaraderie that transcends traditional loyalties.鐵木真的領導風格在當時是革命性的。 他根據功績而非親屬關係任命領導人，從而培養追隨者的忠誠。 他實施軍事戰略，確保徹底戰勝戰敗的部落，並在他的戰士中公平地重新分配戰利品。 他的改革促進了蒙古部落之間的團結，鼓勵通婚並建立了超越傳統忠誠的友誼意識。

# Betrayal and Resilience背叛與堅韌

Temüjin's rise threatens the authority of Ong Khan, who attempts to eliminate him through treachery. However, Temüjin learns of the plot and escapes, solidifying the loyalty of his followers through the Baljina Covenant, a moment of divine intervention that strengthens their bond. Following this, Temüjin launches a counterattack against Ong Khan, decisively defeating him and consolidating his power over Mongolia.鐵木真的崛起威脅到了翁汗的權威，翁汗試圖透過背叛來消滅他。 然而，鐵木真得知了這個陰謀並逃跑了，透過巴爾吉納盟約鞏固了他的追隨者的忠誠，這是神聖幹預的時刻，加強了他們的聯繫。 隨後，鐵木真對翁汗發起反擊，果斷擊敗了他，鞏固了他對蒙古的權力。

With his authority established, Temüjin enacts the Great Law, a revolutionary legal code that abolishes practices detrimental to society, such as kidnapping and enslavement. This law emphasizes equality and accountability, requiring even Khans to adhere to its principles. By uniting the nomadic tribes of the steppes, Genghis Khan lays the foundation for the Mongol Empire.鐵木真權威確立後，頒布了《大法》，這是一部革命性的法律法規，廢除了綁架和奴役等對社會有害的做法。 該法律強調平等和問責制，甚至要求可汗也必須遵守其原則。 成吉思汗統一了草原上的遊牧部落，為蒙古帝國奠定了基礎。

# Expansion and Conquest擴張與征服

As Genghis Khan's power grows, he turns his attention southward, seeking to conquer the wealthy kingdoms of China. Between 1207 and 1209, he subdues the Tangut people and later invades the Jurchid, marking the beginning of a long campaign that expands his territory significantly. The spoils of these conquests enrich the Mongol people, introducing them to luxury goods and skilled craftsmen.隨著成吉思汗權力的增長，他將注意力轉向南方，尋求征服富裕的中國王國。 1207年至1209年間，他征服了西夏人，隨後又入侵女吉人，標誌著一場長期徵戰的開始，他的領土大幅擴張。 這些征服的戰利品使蒙古人民富裕起來，向他們介紹了奢侈品和熟練的工匠。

Despite his success, Genghis Khan recognizes the need for trade and economic stability. In 1219, he seeks a partnership with the Khwarizm Empire, but diplomatic efforts fail when the Sultan responds with violence against his envoys. Enraged, Genghis Khan prepares for war, launching a campaign that results in the swift conquest of Central Asia.儘管取得了成功，成吉思汗還是認識到貿易和經濟穩定的必要性。 1219 年，他尋求與花剌子模帝國建立夥伴關係，但蘇丹以暴力對待他的使節，外交努力失敗。 憤怒的成吉思汗準備戰爭，發動了迅速征服中亞的戰役。

# Legacy and Death遺產與死亡

Genghis Khan's military campaigns are characterized by both ruthlessness and strategic brilliance. His forces capture major cities and defeat armies across vast territories, establishing a reputation that instills fear in his enemies. However, his conquests also facilitate cultural exchange and trade, contributing to the interconnectedness of civilizations.成吉思汗的軍事行動既殘酷又富有戰略智慧。 他的軍隊佔領了主要城市並擊敗了廣闊領土上的軍隊，建立了讓敵人感到恐懼的聲譽。 然而，他的征服也促進了文化交流和貿易，促進了文明的相互聯繫。

As Genghis Khan approaches the end of his life, he prepares for succession, appointing his son Ogodai as his successor. He continues to lead military campaigns until his health declines, ultimately passing away shortly before a final victory over the Tangut. His burial is shrouded in secrecy, reflecting the reverence with which he is regarded.成吉思汗生命即將結束時，他為繼位做準備，任命他的兒子窩闊台為繼承人。 他繼續領導軍事行動，直到健康狀況惡化，最終在最終戰勝西夏之前不久去世。 他的葬禮是保密的，反映出人們對他的尊敬。

The Mongol Empire, under Genghis Khan and his descendants, expands to encompass vast territories, influencing cultures and economies across Asia and Europe. Unlike other empires, the Mongols do not impose new technologies or religions but facilitate the transfer of knowledge and goods between different cultures.在成吉思汗及其後裔的領導下，蒙古帝國擴張至廣闊的領土，影響亞洲和歐洲的文化和經濟。 與其他帝國不同，蒙古人並沒有強加新技術或宗教，而是促進不同文化之間的知識和商品轉移。

# Conclusion結論

Genghis Khan's legacy is complex, marked by both destruction and cultural exchange. While he is often remembered for his military conquests, his contributions to trade, governance, and cultural communication are equally significant. The impact of his rule continues to resonate, shaping the course of history and the development of civilizations. Genghis Khan's life serves as a reminder of the multifaceted nature of leadership and the enduring influence of one individual on the world stage.成吉思汗的遺產是複雜的，以破壞和文化交流為標誌。 雖然他經常因軍事征服而被銘記，但他對貿易、治理和文化交流的貢獻同樣重要。 他的統治的影響繼續產生共鳴，塑造歷史進程和文明發展。 成吉思汗的一生提醒人們領導力的多面性以及一個人在世界舞台上的持久影響力。

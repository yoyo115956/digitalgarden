# Introduction 介紹

Christopher McDougall's "Born to Run" explores the world of running through the lens of the Tarahumara people, an indigenous tribe in Mexico known for their extraordinary long-distance running abilities. McDougall's journey begins with a simple question: why does his foot hurt? This inquiry leads him to discover the secrets of the Tarahumara, who can run for hundreds of miles with apparent ease and joy. The book delves into the science of running, the cultural significance of the sport, and the potential for humans to reconnect with their innate ability to run.克里斯多福·麥克杜格爾的《天生就會跑》透過塔拉烏馬拉人的鏡頭探索了跑步的世界，塔拉烏馬拉人是墨西哥的一個土著部落，以其非凡的長跑能力而聞名。麥克杜格爾的旅程始於一個簡單的問題：為什麼他的腳會受傷？這次調查讓他發現了塔拉烏馬拉人的秘密，塔拉烏馬拉人可以輕鬆愉快地奔跑數百英里。這本書深入探討了跑步的科學、這項運動的文化意義，以及人類與生俱來的跑步能力重新連結的潛力。

# The Primal Connection of Running跑步的原始聯繫

Running is a primal instinct that intertwines fear and pleasure. The history of running in the United States has seen several booms, often coinciding with national crises, such as the Great Depression and the aftermath of 9/11. These events trigger a return to running as a means of coping with stress and finding joy. Despite the popularity of running, many people experience injuries, leading to a paradox where the very act meant to bring pleasure often results in pain. McDougall's personal struggles with running injuries fuel his quest to find a way to enjoy running without the associated pain.跑步是一種將恐懼和快樂交織在一起的原始本能。美國跑步運動的歷史曾經歷過幾次繁榮，通常與國家危機同時發生，例如大蕭條和 9/11 事件的後果。這些事件促使人們重新開始跑步，以此作為應對壓力和尋找快樂的一種方式。儘管跑步很受歡迎，但許多人都遭受過傷害，這導致了一個悖論：本來旨在帶來快樂的行為往往會帶來痛苦。麥克杜格爾個人與跑步受傷的鬥爭促使他尋找一種享受跑步而又沒有相關疼痛的方法。

# The Tarahumara Identity and Culture塔拉烏馬拉人的身分與文化

The Tarahumara, or raramuri, view running as an integral part of their identity. Their culture emphasizes running as a necessary skill for survival and community bonding. The game of rarahi pari exemplifies this, where villages compete in long-distance races that can last for hours or even days. This cultural perspective fosters a love for running, which is essential for enduring the challenges of life. The Tarahumara's mindset and lifestyle contribute to their remarkable endurance and low injury rates, suggesting that running can be a joyful and fulfilling experience when approached with the right attitude.塔拉烏馬拉人（Tarahumara）或拉拉穆里人（raramuri）將跑步視為他們身份不可分割的一部分。他們的文化強調跑步是生存和社區連結的必要技能。 rarahi pari 遊戲體現了這一點，村莊之間進行長距離比賽，可持續數小時甚至數天。這種文化視角培養了人們對跑步的熱愛，這對於承受生活的挑戰至關重要。塔拉烏馬拉人的心態和生活方式造就了他們卓越的耐力和較低的受傷率，這表明，只要態度正確，跑步可以成為一種快樂而充實的經歷。

# Evolutionary Adaptation for Running跑步的演化適應

Humans are evolutionarily designed for long-distance running. Unlike four-legged animals that must stop to cool down, humans can sweat, allowing for prolonged activity. Our upright posture and unique anatomical features, such as the Achilles tendon, enhance our running efficiency. Studies show that humans can maintain endurance over time, with older runners often outperforming younger ones. This evolutionary background highlights that running is not just a sport but a fundamental aspect of human survival and development.人類在進化上是為長跑而設計的。與必須停下來降溫的四足動物不同，人類可以出汗，從而可以長時間活動。我們的直立姿勢和獨特的解剖學特徵（例如跟腱）提高了我們的跑步效率。研究表明，隨著時間的推移，人類可以保持耐力，年長的跑步者往往表現優於年輕的跑步者。這個進化背景凸顯出跑步不僅僅是一項運動，而且是人類生存和發展的基本面向。

# Embracing Pain and Fatigue擁抱疼痛和疲勞

To improve as long-distance runners, individuals must learn to embrace pain and fatigue. McDougall introduces Caballo Blanco, a former boxer who adopts a Tarahumara lifestyle and finds joy in running through suffering. This perspective challenges the common mindset that views running as a chore. Instead, by relaxing into the rhythm of running and tuning into bodily sensations, runners can transform their experience. McDougall's eventual participation in a race against the Tarahumara reflects his growing appreciation for running as a joyful pursuit rather than a painful obligation.為了提高長跑運動員的水平，個人必須學會擁抱疼痛和疲勞。麥克杜格爾介紹了卡巴洛·布蘭科（Caballo Blanco），他是一名前拳擊手，採用塔拉烏馬拉式的生活方式，並在克服痛苦中找到樂趣。這種觀點挑戰了將跑步視為苦差事的普遍觀念。相反，透過放鬆自己的跑步節奏並適應身體感覺，跑步者可以改變他們的體驗。麥克杜格爾最終參加了與塔拉烏馬拉人的比賽，這反映出他越來越認識到跑步是一種快樂的追求，而不是一種痛苦的義務。

# The Benefits of a Plant-Based Diet植物性飲食的好處

Nutrition plays a crucial role in running performance. McDougall highlights the Tarahumara's simple, plant-based diet, rich in nutrients and devoid of processed foods. Scott Jurek, a top ultra-runner, adopts a similar vegan diet and experiences improved performance. Historical examples of successful endurance athletes on vegetarian diets further support the idea that plant-based nutrition can enhance running capabilities. This dietary shift allows for better digestion and energy utilization, ultimately leading to improved endurance.營養對於跑步表現起著至關重要的作用。麥克杜格爾強調了塔拉烏馬拉人簡單的植物性飲食，富含營養，不含加工食品。頂級超級跑運動員斯科特·尤雷克（Scott Jurek）採用了類似的純素飲食，並獲得了成績的提高。歷史上耐力運動員成功採用素食的例子進一步支持了植物性營養可以增強跑步能力的觀點。這種飲食轉變可以更好地消化和能量利用，最終提高耐力。

# The Myth of Running Shoes跑鞋的神話

The book critiques the modern running shoe industry, arguing that traditional shoes can hinder natural foot movement and contribute to injuries. Barefoot running advocates, like Barefoot Ted, demonstrate that running without shoes can lead to better form and fewer injuries. The cushioning and support provided by modern shoes may mask pain but do not address the underlying issues. McDougall suggests that embracing a more natural approach to running, including barefoot techniques, can enhance performance and reduce injury risk.該書批評了現代跑鞋行業，認為傳統鞋會阻礙足部的自然運動並導致受傷。赤腳跑步的倡導者，如赤腳泰德，證明不穿鞋跑步可以帶來更好的狀態並減少受傷。現代鞋子提供的緩衝和支撐可能會掩蓋疼痛，但不能解決根本問題。麥克杜格爾建議，採用更自然的跑步方式，包括赤腳技術，可以提高表現並降低受傷風險。

# Running as Meditation 跑步作為冥想

Running can serve as a powerful form of meditation, allowing individuals to connect with their thoughts and surroundings. The experiences of Jen Shelton and Billy Barnett illustrate how running can lead to personal transformation and a deeper understanding of oneself. Their journey from party-goers to accomplished ultra-runners highlights the meditative aspects of running, where the act of moving through nature fosters clarity and peace.跑步可以作為一種強大的冥想形式，讓個人與自己的思想和周圍環境聯繫起來。珍謝爾頓和比利巴尼特的經歷說明跑步如何能帶來個人轉變和對自己的更深入的了解。他們從派對常客到成功的超級跑步者的旅程凸顯了跑步的冥想方面，在大自然中行走的行為可以促進清晰度與平靜。

# Training Like the Tarahumara像塔拉烏馬拉人一樣訓練

As the race day approaches, McDougall prepares by adopting Tarahumara training methods, including a focus on nutrition, minimalist footwear, and strength training. His transformation leads to significant improvements in his running ability and overall well-being. The race itself becomes a celebration of running, showcasing the joy and camaraderie that can be found in the sport. The competition between the Tarahumara and American runners emphasizes the shared love of running, transcending cultural boundaries.隨著比賽當天的臨近，麥克杜格爾採用塔拉烏馬拉訓練方法進行準備，包括注重營養、簡約鞋類和肌力訓練。他的轉變導致他的跑步能力和整體健康狀況顯著提高。比賽本身成為了對跑步的慶祝，展現了這項運動中的快樂和友誼。塔拉烏馬拉人和美國跑步者之間的比賽強調了對跑步的共同熱愛，超越了文化界限。

# Conclusion 結論

"Born to Run" ultimately conveys that humans possess inherent traits that make them exceptional long-distance runners. To unlock this potential, individuals should focus on nurturing their bodies through plant-based nutrition, minimizing reliance on high-tech footwear, and rediscovering the joy of running. By embracing a child-like approach to running and tuning into their natural abilities, people can enhance their endurance and overall happiness. McDougall's journey serves as an inspiring reminder that running is not just a physical activity but a profound expression of our humanity.「天生會跑」最終傳達了人類擁有天生的特質，使他們成為出色的長跑運動員。為了釋放這項潛力，人們應該專注於透過植物性營養來滋養自己的身體，盡量減少對高科技鞋類的依賴，並重新發現跑步的樂趣。透過採用像孩子一樣的跑步方式並適應他們的自然能力，人們可以增強他們的耐力和整體幸福感。麥克杜格爾的旅程鼓舞人心地提醒我們，跑步不僅僅是一項身體活動，也是我們人性的深刻表達。

# Introduction介紹

The story of Anne Frank, as chronicled in "The Diary of a Young Girl," is one of the most poignant narratives to emerge from World War II. Anne's diary, written during her family's time in hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam, captures the essence of her youthful spirit, her aspirations, and the harsh realities of life during a time of persecution. Millions visit the Anne Frank House each year, drawn by the profound impact of her words, which resonate with themes of hope, loss, and the resilience of the human spirit.《少女日記》中記載的安妮法蘭克的故事是二戰中最令人心酸的故事之一。 安妮的日記是在她的家人在阿姆斯特丹躲避納粹的時候寫的，捕捉到了她年輕的精神、她的抱負以及在迫害時期生活的嚴酷現實的精髓。 每年都有數百萬人參觀安妮法蘭克之家，他們被她話語的深刻影響所吸引，這些話語與希望、失落和人類精神的韌性等主題產生了共鳴。

# From Schoolgirl to Girl in Hiding從女學生到躲藏女孩

Anne Frank received her diary on her 13th birthday, June 12, 1942. Initially, her entries reflect the typical concerns of a young girl—school, friendships, and budding romances. However, the backdrop of increasing anti-Jewish laws in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam soon overshadowed her youthful innocence. The call-up notice for her sister Margot marked a turning point, forcing the Frank family to go into hiding. They moved into a concealed space at the back of Otto Frank's workplace, the Opecta building, where they would live in fear and isolation.1942 年 6 月 12 日，安妮·弗蘭克 (Anne Frank) 在她 13 歲生日那天收到了她的日記。 然而，納粹佔領的阿姆斯特丹反猶太法律日益增多的背景很快就掩蓋了她年輕時的純真。 她妹妹瑪戈特的徵召通知標誌著一個轉捩點，迫使弗蘭克一家躲藏起來。 他們搬進了奧托·弗蘭克工作場所 Opecta 大樓後面的一個隱蔽空間，在那裡他們生活在恐懼和孤立之中。

# The Secret Annex秘密附件

The secret annex became a refuge not only for the Frank family but also for the Van Pels family, who joined them shortly after. Living conditions were cramped and fraught with tension, as the families navigated the challenges of cohabitation under constant threat. The annex was ingeniously concealed behind a bookcase, and strict rules governed their daily lives to avoid detection. The fear of discovery loomed large, and Anne's writings reveal her struggle with the duality of her existence—longing for freedom while grappling with the reality of their confinement.這個秘密附屬建築不僅成為了弗蘭克家族的避難所，也成為了不久後加入他們的範佩爾斯家族的避難所。 生活條件擁擠且充滿緊張，因為這些家庭在持續的威脅下應對同居的挑戰。 附屬建築被巧妙地隱藏在書櫃後面，他們的日常生活受到嚴格的規定以避免被發現。 對發現的恐懼日益凸顯，安妮的作品揭示了她與自身存在的二元性的鬥爭——渴望自由，同時與被限制的現實作鬥爭。

# Close Quarters, Different Opinions近距離，不同意見

Life in the annex was marked by interpersonal conflicts and the strain of close quarters. Anne often felt misunderstood by her family, particularly her mother and sister. Her diary entries reflect her frustrations and the growing distance she perceived in her relationships. The arrival of the Van Pels family introduced new dynamics, with Anne initially finding amusement in Mrs. Van Pels' antics but later becoming embroiled in the tensions that arose from differing parenting styles and personalities.附樓裡的生活充滿了人際衝突和近距離的壓力。 安妮經常感到被家人誤解，尤其是她的母親和姐姐。 她的日記反映了她的挫敗感以及她在人際關係中感受到的日益疏遠。 範佩爾斯一家的到來帶來了新的活力，安妮最初對範佩爾斯夫人的滑稽動作感到有趣，但後來捲入了因不同的養育方式和性格而產生的緊張關係。

# Food and Medicine食品和藥品

Food scarcity and health concerns were constant worries for the families in hiding. Anne's father fell ill, highlighting the precariousness of their situation, as they had no access to medical care. The families relied on black market ration coupons for sustenance, leading to monotonous meals and occasional treats during special occasions. The stress of maintaining silence during meal preparations and the fear of making noise added to the anxiety of their daily lives.食物短缺和健康問題一直是躲藏的家庭的擔憂。 安妮的父親生病了，突顯了他們的處境岌岌可危，因為他們無法獲得醫療照護。 這些家庭依靠黑市配給券維持生計，導致膳食單調，在特殊場合偶爾會得到一些款待。 準備飯菜時保持安靜的壓力和對發出噪音的恐懼增加了他們日常生活的焦慮。

# Meet Mr. Dussel認識杜塞爾先生

In November 1942, the annex welcomed a new resident, Mr. Dussel, a dentist. Initially, he seemed to fit in well, but his arrival soon introduced new conflicts, particularly regarding Anne's behavior. Anne's relationship with Mr. Dussel became a source of tension, as he often criticized her, leading her to feel increasingly isolated. Despite the challenges, the families found moments of joy during holidays, which provided brief respite from their grim reality.1942 年 11 月，附屬建築迎來了一位新住戶，他是一名牙醫杜塞爾先生。 最初，他似乎很融入，但他的到來很快就帶來了新的衝突，特別是關於安妮的行為。 安妮與杜塞爾先生的關係變得緊張，因為他經常批評她，導致她感到越來越孤立。 儘管面臨挑戰，這些家庭還是在假期裡找到了歡樂的時刻，這讓他們從嚴峻的現實中得到了短暫的喘息。

# A Noise in the Night夜間的噪音

The constant fear of discovery was compounded by the threat of burglars in Amsterdam. One night, the families experienced a close call when Peter and Mr. Frank ventured downstairs to investigate suspicious noises. The tension escalated as they tried to remain quiet, fearing that any sound could lead to their capture. Anne's writings during this period reflect her determination to maintain a sense of normalcy through her creative endeavors, even as the war raged on outside.阿姆斯特丹的竊賊威脅加劇了人們對被發現的持續恐懼。 一天晚上，彼得和法蘭克先生冒險下樓調查可疑的聲音，一家人遭遇了一次千鈞一髮的事件。 他們試圖保持安靜，擔心任何聲音都會導致他們被捕，緊張氣氛不斷升級。 安妮這一時期的作品反映了她決心透過自己的創作努力來保持一種常態感，即使外面戰事如火如荼。

# Young Love in the Annex年輕時的附件愛情

As Anne matured, her reflections on love and relationships deepened. Her feelings for Peter Van Pels evolved from indifference to affection, culminating in their first kiss in April 1944.

She grappled with her dual nature—one that was light-hearted and carefree, and another that was introspective and serious.隨著安妮的成熟，她對愛情和人際關係的思考也加深了。 她對彼得·範·佩爾斯的感情從冷漠演變為深情，最終在1944 年4 月的初吻中達到頂峰。聯繫的渴望。 她與自己的雙重性格作鬥爭——一個是輕鬆無憂無慮的，另一個是內省而嚴肅的。

# Two Sides of Anne安妮的兩側

She sought to better herself and understand her family dynamics, particularly her relationship with her mother. Anne's introspection led her to recognize her own shortcomings and strive for personal growth. Her diary entries reflect her aspirations to become a writer, and she expressed a desire to share her experiences with the world.在躲藏期間，安妮仍然致力於她的學習和創作。 她尋求改善自己並了解她的家庭動態，特別是她與母親的關係。 安妮的反省使她認識到自己的缺點並努力實現個人成長。 她的日記反映了她成為作家的願望，並表達了與世界分享她的經歷的願望。

# A Book to Change the World一本改變世界的書

The tragic end of Anne's life came when the secret annex was discovered on August 4, 1944. The occupants were arrested and sent to concentration camps, where most of them perished. Otto Frank, the sole survivor, returned to Amsterdam after the war and was given Anne's diary by Miep Gies, who had preserved it. Initially overwhelmed by the emotional weight of his daughter's words, Otto eventually recognized the significance of Anne's writings and sought to share her story with the world.1944 年 8 月 4 日，秘密附屬建築被發現，安妮的悲慘結局隨之而來。 奧托·弗蘭克（Otto Frank）是唯一的倖存者，戰後回到阿姆斯特丹，米普·吉斯（Miep Gies）將安妮的日記交給了他，並保存了下來。 奧托最初被女兒話語中的情感分量所震撼，但最終認識到安妮作品的重要性，並試圖與世界分享她的故事。

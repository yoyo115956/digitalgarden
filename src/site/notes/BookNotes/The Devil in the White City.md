# Introduction 介紹

The narrative of "The Devil in the White City" by Erik Larson transports readers to turn-of-the-century Chicago, a city that transformed from a quiet Midwest town into a bustling metropolis known for its vibrant culture and dark underbelly. The book intertwines the story of the World's Columbian Exposition, a monumental fair that showcased American innovation and ambition, with the chilling tale of Henry Howard Holmes, one of the first known serial killers in the United States.拉森（Erik Larson）的《白城惡魔》的敘述將讀者帶到了世紀之交的芝加哥，這座城市從一個安靜的中西部小鎮轉變為一個以其充滿活力的文化和黑暗的弱點而聞名的繁華大都市。這本書將世界哥倫布博覽會的故事與美國最早的連環殺手之一亨利·霍華德·福爾摩斯的令人毛骨悚然的故事交織在一起，哥倫布博覽會是一個展示美國創新和雄心的紀念性博覽會。

# Life in Late 19th Century Chicago19 世紀末芝加哥的生活

As the 19th century came to a close, Chicago was a city marked by chaos and crime. The streets were dangerous, with an alarming number of deaths occurring at railroad crossings and due to rampant fires in the wooden structures that dominated the cityscape. The public health crisis was exacerbated by a contaminated water supply, leading to outbreaks of cholera and typhus. The living conditions in poorer neighborhoods were dire, with trash-filled streets and a lack of sanitation services. Despite the violence and disease, the city was also experiencing significant social change, particularly with women entering the workforce in unprecedented numbers, contributing to the burgeoning economy.十九世紀末，芝加哥是一座充滿混亂與犯罪的城市。街道很危險，鐵路道口的死亡人數驚人，城市景觀中木質結構的火災猖獗。供水污染加劇了公共衛生危機，導致霍亂和斑疹傷寒的爆發。貧困社區的生活條件十分惡劣，街上垃圾遍地，而且缺乏衛生服務。儘管存在暴力和疾病，這座城市也正在經歷重大的社會變革，特別是女性以前所未有的數量進入勞動力市場，為蓬勃發展的經濟做出了貢獻。

# Hosting the World's Columbian Exposition舉辦世界哥倫布博覽會

In 1890, Chicago was selected to host the World's Columbian Exposition, a decision that came with immense pressure to create a spectacle that would rival the grand fairs of Europe, particularly the Exposition Universelle in Paris. The fair was intended to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the Americas and to showcase American ingenuity and culture. Chicago's selection was surprising given its reputation for corruption and violence, but the city's residents were determined to prove their worth on the world stage.1890 年，芝加哥被選為舉辦世界哥倫布博覽會，這項決定是在巨大的壓力下做出的，因為它需要創造一個可以與歐洲盛大博覽會（特別是巴黎世界博覽會）相媲美的奇觀。博覽會旨在慶祝哥倫布抵達美洲 400 週年，並展示美國的聰明才智和文化。考慮到芝加哥腐敗和暴力的名聲，芝加哥的選擇令人驚訝，但該市居民決心在世界舞台上證明自己的價值。

# Challenges in Construction施工中的挑戰

Daniel Burnham, a prominent architect, was appointed to oversee the construction of the fair. Despite his charisma and experience, Burnham faced numerous challenges, including a tight budget and a struggling economy. The construction site was fraught with danger, and many workers lost their lives during the building process. Nevertheless, Burnham managed to complete the fair on time, creating a stunning temporary city known as "The White City," characterized by its neoclassical architecture and brilliant white facades.著名建築師丹尼爾·伯納姆 (Daniel Burnham) 被任命負責監督博覽會的建設。儘管伯納姆擁有超凡的魅力和豐富的經驗，但他仍面臨許多挑戰，包括預算緊張和經濟不景氣。工地危險重重，不少工人在施工過程中喪生。儘管如此，伯納姆還是設法按時完成了博覽會，創建了一座令人驚嘆的臨時城市，被稱為“白色之城”，其特點是新古典主義建築和明亮的白色外牆。

# The Success of the Fair展會的成功舉辦

The World's Columbian Exposition opened in 1893 and was a resounding success, attracting over 27 million visitors during its six-month run. The fair showcased groundbreaking inventions and innovations, including the first zipper, the first all-electric kitchen, and the Ferris wheel, which was a marvel of engineering. The event was a cultural milestone, featuring notable figures such as Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, and it even marked the first recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance by American schoolchildren. However, the fair's glamour could not mask the underlying issues of violence and crime that plagued the city.世界哥倫布博覽會於 1893 年開幕，取得了巨大成功，在六個月的舉辦期間吸引了超過 2700 萬遊客。展會展示了突破性的發明和創新，包括第一個拉鍊、第一個全電動廚房和工程奇蹟的摩天輪。這次活動是一個文化里程碑，其中包括托馬斯·愛迪生和尼古拉·特斯拉等著名人物，它甚至標誌著美國學童首次背誦效忠誓言。然而，博覽會的魅力並不能掩蓋困擾這座城市的暴力和犯罪的根本問題。

# The Dark Side of the Fair博覽會的陰暗面

Amid the excitement of the fair, the city remained a dangerous place, exemplified by the actions of Henry Howard Holmes. Presenting himself as a charming physician, Holmes was, in reality, a conman and a murderer who lured young women to their deaths. He operated a hotel designed specifically for his nefarious activities, equipped with gas pipes and soundproof rooms for committing his crimes. Holmes's gruesome methods included dissection and the sale of body parts to medical institutions. His reign of terror coincided with the fair, and he is believed to have killed between 20 and 200 victims before being apprehended and ultimately executed in 1896.在博覽會的熱鬧氣氛中，這座城市仍然是一個危險的地方，亨利·霍華德·霍姆斯的行為證明了這一點。福爾摩斯自詡為迷人的醫生，實際上是一個騙子和一個引誘年輕女性死亡的兇手。他經營一家專為他的邪惡活動設計的酒店，配備了煤氣管道和隔音房間供他犯罪。霍姆斯的可怕手段包括解剖以及將身體部位出售給醫療機構。他的恐怖統治恰逢集市，據信他殺害了 20 至 200 名受害者，然後在 1896 年被捕並最終被處決。

# Conclusion 結論

"The Devil in the White City" offers a compelling exploration of the duality of Chicago at the turn of the century, highlighting its industrial growth and cultural aspirations alongside the brutal realities of crime and violence. The juxtaposition of the World's Columbian Exposition and the chilling story of Henry Howard Holmes serves as a reminder of the complexities of human nature and the darker aspects of society that can exist even in the midst of progress and celebration.《白城惡魔》對世紀之交芝加哥的二元性進行了引人入勝的探索，突顯了其工業發展和文化抱負以及犯罪和暴力的殘酷現實。世界哥倫布博覽會和亨利·霍華德·福爾摩斯的令人毛骨悚然的故事並列在一起，提醒人們人性的複雜性以及即使在進步和慶祝活動中也可能存在的社會陰暗面。

# Introduction to Small Business Success小型企業成功簡介

The E-Myth Revisited by Michael E. Gerber explores the reasons behind the high failure rates of small businesses and offers insights into achieving lasting success. Many entrepreneurs mistakenly believe that having a great idea and technical skills is enough to succeed. However, the reality is that a significant number of small businesses fail within their first few years. This guide aims to provide a roadmap for building a successful business that can thrive beyond the initial stages.Michael E. Gerber 的《E-Myth Revisited》探討了小型企業高失敗率背後的原因，並提供了持久成功的見解。 許多企業家錯誤地認為擁有好點子和技術技能就足以成功。 然而，現實情況是，大量小企業在最初幾年內就倒閉了。 本指南旨在提供路線圖，幫助您建立一個能夠超越初始階段並蓬勃發展的成功企業。

# Understanding the Entrepreneurial Myth理解創業神話

The first major insight is the Entrepreneurial Myth (E-Myth), which highlights the misconception that technical expertise alone guarantees business success. Many individuals start businesses based on their skills in a specific field, such as cooking or programming, without understanding the complexities of running a business. This often leads to failure, as technical skills do not translate to effective business management. For instance, a skilled barista may struggle to manage a café due to a lack of knowledge in hiring, organization, and growth strategies.第一個主要見解是創業神話（E-Myth），它強調了一種誤解，即僅技術專業知識就能保證業務成功。 許多人根據自己在特定領域（例如烹飪或程式設計）的技能創業，而不了解經營企業的複雜性。 這通常會導致失敗，因為技術技能無法轉化為有效的業務管理。 例如，熟練的咖啡師可能會因為缺乏招募、組織和發展策略方面的知識而難以管理一家咖啡館。

# Stages of Business Development業務發展階段

Businesses, like individuals, go through stages of development: infancy, adolescence, and maturity. In the infancy stage, the owner is deeply involved in every aspect of the business, which can become overwhelming as demand grows. As the business transitions into adolescence, the owner may hire employees but struggle with delegation, leading to a decline in quality and customer satisfaction. To succeed, business owners must recognize the need for growth and plan accordingly from the outset.企業和個人一樣，都會經歷發展階段：嬰兒期、青春期和成熟期。 在起步階段，業主深入參與業務的各個方面，隨著需求的成長，這可能會變得勢不可擋。 隨著企業進入青春期，業主可能會僱用員工，但會與授權鬥爭，導致品質和客戶滿意度下降。 為了取得成功，企業主必須認識到成長的必要性，並從一開始就做出相應的規劃。

# Planning for Growth規劃成長

To nurture a business beyond adolescence, it is crucial to plan from the beginning. Successful businesses are built with a long-term perspective, focusing on how the business will operate independently of the owner. This requires an entrepreneurial perspective that considers market opportunities, ideal customers, and innovative delivery methods. For example, a barista might identify eco-conscious students as her target market and develop a unique selling proposition around locally sourced ingredients.為了培育超越青春期的企業，從一開始就做好規劃至關重要。 成功的企業都是以長遠的眼光建立的，注重企業如何獨立於所有者運作。 這需要以企業家的視角來考慮市場機會、理想客戶和創新的交付方式。 例如，咖啡師可能會將具有生態意識的學生視為她的目標市場，並圍繞當地採購的原料製定獨特的銷售主張。

# Embracing Multiple Business Personalities擁抱多種商業個性

Every entrepreneur embodies multiple personalities: the entrepreneur, the manager, and the technician. The entrepreneur is the visionary, the manager seeks order, and the technician focuses on execution. A successful business requires a balance of these personalities, with the average small business owner typically being 10% entrepreneur, 20% manager, and 70% technician. Recognizing and leveraging these different aspects can help avoid common pitfalls.每個企業家都體現了多重人格：企業家、管理者和技術人員。 企業家是有遠見的，管理者是追求秩序的，技術員是注重執行力的。 成功的企業需要平衡這些個性，一般小型企業主通常 10% 是企業家，20% 是經理，70% 是技術人員。 認識並利用這些不同的方面可以幫助避免常見的陷阱。

# The Turnkey Revolution統包革命

The turnkey revolution represents a shift in how businesses are structured, emphasizing replicable systems that allow for easy management by anyone. Franchises exemplify this model, with a high success rate compared to independent small businesses. To create a turnkey business, entrepreneurs must develop a business format franchise that outlines processes, systems, and organizational structures, making it appealing for potential franchisees.交鑰匙革命代表了企業結構方式的轉變，強調可複製的系統，讓任何人可以輕鬆管理。 特許經營就是這種模式的典範，與獨立的小型企業相比，特許經營的成功率很高。 要創建交鑰匙業務，企業家必須開發特許經營業務模式，概述流程、系統和組織結構，使其對潛在的特許經營者有吸引力。

# Creating a Franchise Prototype創建特許經營原型

To build a successful franchise, entrepreneurs should create a prototype that delivers consistent value and is easy to operate. This involves designing systems that do not rely on the owner's expertise and documenting every process in an operations manual. The prototype should ensure predictable service, allowing customers to have a consistent experience, which is crucial for building a loyal customer base.為了建立成功的特許經營權，企業家應該創建一個能夠提供一致價值且易於操作的原型。 這涉及設計不依賴所有者專業知識的系統，並在操作手冊中記錄每個流程。 原型應確保可預測的服務，讓客戶獲得一致的體驗，這對於建立忠誠的客戶群至關重要。

# Aligning Business with Personal Goals使業務與個人目標一致

Starting a business should align with the entrepreneur's personal aims in life. Understanding one's primary aim—what kind of life one wants to live—helps shape the business's strategic objectives. This includes financial goals and market opportunities that the business must fulfill to achieve the owner's aspirations. For instance, a barista might aim to earn a specific income while maintaining a work-life balance.創業應該與創業家的個人人生目標一致。 了解一個人的主要目標—一個人想要過什麼樣的生活—有助於制定企業的策略目標。 這包括企業必須實現的財務目標和市場機會，以實現所有者的願望。 例如，咖啡師的目標可能是在保持工作與生活平衡的同時賺取特定收入。

# Importance of Organizational Structure組織結構的重要性

An effective organizational structure is vital for growth and accountability. Entrepreneurs should draft organizational charts that outline roles and responsibilities, even if starting as a one-person operation. Each position should have a clear contract detailing expectations and standards. This clarity helps ensure that as the business grows, employees understand their roles and are held accountable for their performance.有效的組織結構對於成長和問責至關重要。 企業家應該起草組織結構圖來概述角色和職責，即使是從一個人的運作開始。 每個職位都應該有一份明確的合同，詳細說明期望和標準。 這種清晰度有助於確保隨著業務的發展，員工了解自己的角色並對自己的績效負責。

# Implementing a People Management System實施人員管理系統

Successful management relies on a robust people management system rather than solely on hiring talented individuals. This system should treat employee management as a marketing tool, ensuring that employees understand the purpose of their work and are motivated to contribute to the business's goals. For example, a barista could encourage creativity in her baker by allowing him to choose ingredients and design his own cake schedule, fostering enthusiasm and better customer experiences.成功的管理依賴強大的人員管理體系，而不僅僅是僱用人才。 該系統應將員工管理視為一種行銷工具，確保員工了解其工作目的並有動力為業務目標做出貢獻。 例如，咖啡師可以透過允許麵包師選擇原料並設計自己的蛋糕時間表來鼓勵麵包師的創造力，從而培養熱情和更好的客戶體驗。

# Focusing on the Customer以客戶為中心

A customer-centric approach is essential for marketing success. Entrepreneurs should prioritize understanding their customers' demographics and psychographics to tailor their offerings effectively. Gathering customer feedback through surveys can provide valuable insights, allowing businesses to adapt their marketing strategies to meet customer needs. Consistency in marketing efforts helps build brand loyalty and attracts potential franchisees.以客戶為中心的方法對於行銷成功至關重要。 創業家應優先了解客戶的人口統計和心理特徵，以有效地客製化他們的產品。 透過調查收集客戶回饋可以提供有價值的見解，使企業能夠調整行銷策略以滿足客戶需求。 行銷工作的一致性有助於建立品牌忠誠度並吸引潛在的特許經營者。

# Building Functional Systems建構功能係統

Ultimately, a successful business is a collection of interdependent systems that work together seamlessly. These systems include hard systems (physical assets), soft systems (human elements), and information systems (data management). Entrepreneurs must ensure that changes in one area do not negatively impact others. For example, upgrading equipment should consider employee training and customer satisfaction to maintain service quality.最終，成功的企業是無縫協作的相互依賴的系統的集合。 這些系統包括硬系統（實體資產）、軟系統（人的因素）和資訊系統（資料管理）。 企業家必須確保某一領域的改變不會對其他領域產生負面影響。 例如，升級設備應考慮員工培訓和客戶滿意度，以維持服務品質。

# Continuous Improvement持續改進

The process of planning and implementing business strategies is ongoing. Entrepreneurs must engage in continuous innovation, quantification, and orchestration to adapt to changing market conditions. This involves regularly assessing what works and what doesn’t, making adjustments as necessary. The business development process is cyclical, with innovation leading to new strategies, which are then measured and refined.規劃和實施業務策略的過程正在進行中。 企業家必須不斷創新、量化和編排，以適應不斷變化的市場條件。 這包括定期評估哪些有效，哪些無效，並根據需要進行調整。 業務發展過程是週期性的，創新導致新的策略，然後對新策略進行衡量和改進。

# Conclusion結論

The E-Myth Revisited emphasizes that most small businesses fail due to a lack of understanding of how to build a sustainable business model. By approaching business development with a franchise mindset, entrepreneurs can significantly increase their chances of success. The key takeaway is to work on the business as a whole rather than getting lost in day-to-day operations. This strategic approach, combined with a focus on systems and customer needs, can lead to a thriving enterprise.《重新審視電子迷思》強調，大多數小型企業的失敗是由於缺乏對如何建立永續商業模式的了解。 透過以特許經營心態進行業務發展，企業家可以顯著增加成功的機會。 關鍵在於將業務作為一個整體來開展工作，而不是迷失在日常營運中。 這種策略方法與對系統和客戶需求的關注相結合，可以使企業蓬勃發展。

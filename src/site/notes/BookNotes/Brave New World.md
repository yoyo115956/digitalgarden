# Introduction介紹

Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World," published in 1932, presents a dystopian society known as the World State, which is built on the principles of efficiency, consumption, and collectivism. The society worships Henry Ford and his assembly line philosophy, leading to the mass production of human beings, who are biologically engineered for their social roles. Unlike the oppressive regime depicted in George Orwell's "1984," Huxley's world is characterized by a population that willingly submits to control, finding pleasure in their subjugation. This summary explores key locations and events in the novel, starting with the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre.奧爾德斯·赫胥黎(Aldous Huxley) 於1932 年出版的《美麗新世界》描繪了一個被稱為「世界國家」的反烏托邦社會，它建立在效率、消費和集體主義的原則之上。 這個社會崇拜亨利·福特和他的裝配線哲學，導致人類的大規模生產，而人類是根據其社會角色進行生物設計的。 與喬治·奧威爾的《1984》中描繪的壓迫政權不同，赫胥黎的世界的特徵是人民心甘情願地服從控制，並在征服中尋找樂趣。 本摘要探討了小說中的關鍵地點和事件，從倫敦市中心孵化場和調節中心開始。

# Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre倫敦市中心孵化場與調節中心

The Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre epitomizes the World State's motto: "Community, Identity, Stability." Here, human beings are created and conditioned in a sterile, laboratory environment. The concept of parenthood is obsolete; children are produced in labs, and the term "mother" is considered obscene. The hatchery employs a process called Bokunovsky's process, which allows for the cloning of up to 96 identical individuals, ensuring a uniform population that contributes to social stability.倫敦市中心孵化場和調節中心體現了世界國家的座右銘：「社區、認同、穩定」。 在這裡，人類是在無菌的實驗室環境中被創造和調節的。 為人父母的概念已經過時了； 孩子是在實驗室生產的，「母親」這個詞被認為是淫穢的。 該孵化場採用了一種稱為博庫諾夫斯基工藝的工藝，可以克隆多達 96 個相同的個體，確保族群的統一，從而有助於社會穩定。

From the moment of conception, individuals are predestined for specific roles in society. Alphas and betas are prepared for leadership positions, while gammas, deltas, and epsilons are conditioned for menial tasks. A significant portion of the population is rendered sterile to prevent uncontrolled reproduction. Psychological conditioning begins in infancy, instilling a hatred for books and flowers—elements that could disrupt the social order. Through hypnopedic lessons, individuals learn to accept and enjoy their predetermined fates, eliminating the possibility of rebellion or dissatisfaction.從受孕的那一刻起，個人就注定要在社會中扮演特定的角色。 Alpha 和 Beta 適合擔任領導職位，而 gamma、Delta 和 Epsilon 則適合從事卑微的任務。 很大一部分人口處於不孕狀態，以防止不受控制的繁殖。 心理調節從嬰兒時期就開始了，逐漸灌輸對書籍和花朵的仇恨——這些元素可能會擾亂社會秩序。 透過催眠課程，個人學會接受並享受他們預定的命運，消除叛逆或不滿的可能性。

The hatchery illustrates the extreme measures taken to maintain social stability, contrasting with the more violent control methods seen in "1984." The conditioning process in "Brave New World" is so thorough that individuals are not only compliant but also content with their roles, highlighting the novel's exploration of freedom and happiness.孵化場體現了為維護社會穩定而採取的極端措施，與《1984》中較暴力的控製手段形成鮮明對比。 《美麗新世界》的調節過程如此徹底，個體不僅順從而且滿足於自己的角色，凸顯了小說對自由與幸福的探索。

# The Reservation預訂

The narrative shifts to the Reservation, a stark contrast to the World State. Bernard Marx, an introspective member of society, visits Malpais, a pueblo in New Mexico inhabited by "savages." Accompanied by Lenina Crowne, a woman from the World State, Bernard is confronted with the realities of life outside their engineered society. They encounter John, the son of a woman named Linda, who was abandoned in the Reservation after being accidentally impregnated.敘述轉向保留地，與世界狀態形成鮮明對比。 伯納德·馬克思是一位善於內省的社會成員，他訪問了馬爾佩斯，這是新墨西哥州一個居住著「野蠻人」的村莊。 在來自世界國家的女性列寧娜·克朗的陪伴下，伯納德面對著他們設計的社會之外的生活現實。 他們遇到了約翰，一個名叫琳達的女人的兒子，她在意外懷孕後被遺棄在保留地。

John, raised on Shakespeare's works, embodies the clash between the two worlds. His upbringing in Malpais, where traditional values like motherhood and aging exist, starkly contrasts with the sterile, pleasure-driven society of the World State. John's fascination with the World State is rooted in his mother's stories, but he is also deeply aware of the pain and humiliation he has experienced due to his mother's promiscuity.約翰是在莎士比亞的作品中長大的，他體現了兩個世界之間的衝突。 他在馬爾佩斯長大，那裡存在著母性和衰老等傳統價值觀，與世界國家貧瘠、享樂驅動的社會形成鮮明對比。 約翰對世界國家的迷戀植根於他母親的故事，但他也深深意識到他因母親的濫交而經歷的痛苦和羞辱。

This chapter introduces John as a complex character who represents the merging of two worlds. His exposure to Shakespeare's literature shapes his understanding of love, morality, and individuality, setting the stage for his eventual disillusionment with the World State.本章介紹了約翰這個複雜的人物，他代表了兩個世界的融合。 他對莎士比亞文學的接觸塑造了他對愛、道德和個性的理解，為他最終對世界國家的幻滅奠定了基礎。

# This Brave New World這個美麗的新世界

Upon returning to London with John, now referred to as "the Savage," the stark differences between their cultures become evident. John's initial excitement quickly turns to horror as he witnesses the dehumanizing aspects of the World State, particularly in a factory where identical twins are produced. His reaction culminates in a violent bout of vomiting, symbolizing his rejection of the society's values.與現在被稱為「野蠻人」的約翰一起返回倫敦後，他們文化之間的明顯差異變得顯而易見。 當約翰目睹了世界國家非人性的一面，特別是在生產同卵雙胞胎的工廠時，他最初的興奮很快就變成了恐懼。 他的反應以劇烈嘔吐達到高潮，象徵他對社會價值的拒絕。

While John becomes a sensation in London, his mother Linda is largely ignored, as she is considered a relic of the past. Linda's primary concern is her addiction to soma, the World State's pleasure drug, which allows her to escape her painful reality. John, however, is repulsed by the drug and the superficiality of the society around him.雖然約翰在倫敦引起了轟動，但他的母親琳達基本上被忽視了，因為她被認為是過去的遺物。 琳達最擔心的是她對索瑪的依賴，索瑪是世界國家的快樂藥物，它讓她能夠逃避痛苦的現實。 然而，約翰對毒品和周圍社會的膚淺感到厭惡。

John's moral struggle intensifies as he grapples with his feelings for Lenina, who embodies the promiscuity and hedonism of the World State. Despite his attraction, John's upbringing in Malpais instills in him a sense of monogamy and moral integrity, leading to a conflict between his desires and his values. This internal struggle highlights the novel's exploration of individuality versus societal norms.當約翰努力應對自己對列寧娜的感情時，他的道德鬥爭加劇了，列寧娜體現了世界國家的濫交和享樂主義。 儘管約翰很有吸引力，但他在馬爾佩斯的成長向他灌輸了一夫一妻制和道德操守，導致他的慾望和價值觀之間發生衝突。 這種內心的鬥爭凸顯了小說對個性與社會規範的探索。

# Park Lane Hospital for the Dying公園巷臨終醫院

John's emotional turmoil reaches a breaking point when he learns that Linda is dying in the Park Lane Hospital for the Dying. The World State's casual attitude toward death contrasts sharply with John's deep sense of grief and loss. As he witnesses the indifference of the children conditioned to view death as a normal biological process, John's anger erupts.當約翰得知琳達在公園巷臨終醫院瀕臨死亡時，他的情緒陷入了崩潰。 世界國家對死亡的漫不經心的態度與約翰深深的悲傷和失落感形成了鮮明的對比。 當他目睹孩子們習慣將死亡視為正常的生物過程而表現出冷漠時，約翰的憤怒爆發了。

In a moment of desperation, John confronts the crowd, pleading for them to reject soma and recognize the value of life. His passionate outburst leads to a riot, which is swiftly quelled by the release of soma vapor. This event underscores the power of conditioning and the lengths to which the World State will go to maintain control.在絕望的時刻，約翰面對人群，懇求他們拒絕索瑪並認識到生命的價值。 他的熱情爆發導致了一場騷亂，但很快就被釋放的索瑪蒸氣平息了。 這事件強調了調節的力量以及世界國家維持控制的程度。

Following the riot, John, Bernard, and Helmholtz are summoned by Mustafa Mond, one of the World Controllers. Mond explains that their individuality poses a threat to societal stability, and they will be sent to an island where they can exist as individuals. This conversation reveals the philosophical divide between John and Mond, as John argues for the necessity of struggle and suffering in understanding beauty and joy, while Mond defends the World State's pursuit of happiness at the cost of freedom.騷亂發生後，世界控制者之一穆斯塔法·蒙德召喚了約翰、伯納德和亥姆霍茲。 蒙德解釋說，他們的個性對社會穩定構成威脅，他們將被送到一個可以作為個體存在的島嶼。 這段對話揭示了約翰和蒙德之間的哲學分歧，約翰主張在理解美和歡樂時必須經歷鬥爭和痛苦，而蒙德則捍衛世界國家以犧牲自由為代價追求幸福的做法。

# The Lighthouse燈塔

In the final chapter, John retreats to a lighthouse, seeking purification from the contamination of civilization. He engages in self-flagellation as a form of penance, attempting to reconcile his desires with his moral beliefs. However, his actions draw a crowd, and the spectacle of his suffering becomes a source of entertainment for onlookers.在最後一章中，約翰撤退到燈塔，尋求擺脫文明污染的淨化。 他以自虐作為一種贖罪形式，試圖調和他的慾望與他的道德信念。 然而，他的行為吸引了圍觀者，他的痛苦景像也成為旁觀者的娛樂來源。

As the crowd mimics John's behavior, their conditioning leads to a chaotic orgy of atonement, blurring the lines between self-punishment and hedonism. John's internal conflict culminates in a moment of despair as he realizes he cannot escape the temptations of the World State. Ultimately, he succumbs to the very desires he sought to suppress, leading to his tragic demise.當群眾模仿約翰的行為時，他們的調節導致了一場混亂的贖罪狂歡，模糊了自我懲罰和享樂主義之間的界線。 約翰的內心衝突在絕望時刻達到了頂峰，因為他意識到自己無法逃脫世界國家的誘惑。 最終，他屈服於他試圖壓抑的慾望，導致了他的悲劇性死亡。

# Conclusion結論

# Introduction介紹

In "Braiding Sweetgrass," Robin Wall Kimmerer intertwines indigenous wisdom with scientific knowledge, emphasizing the urgent need to address environmental crises. The book highlights the interconnectedness of humanity and nature, urging readers to recognize the importance of gratitude and reciprocity in our relationship with the environment.在《編織甜草》中，羅賓‧沃爾‧基默勒 (Robin Wall Kimmerer) 將原住民智慧與科學知識結合在一起，強調解決環境危機的迫切需求。 這本書強調了人類與自然的相互聯繫，敦促讀者認識到感恩和互惠在我們與環境的關係中的重要性。

# Cultural Duality文化二元性

Kimmerer, a member of the Pottawatomie tribe, reflects on her upbringing in two contrasting worlds: her Native American heritage and modern American society. This duality reveals a significant cultural clash, particularly in how nature is perceived and treated. While Kimmerer's tribe practices a gift economy—where nature's offerings are met with gratitude and reciprocation—modern society often views nature as a commodity. This difference is illustrated through Kimmerer's childhood experiences, such as her enjoyment of wild strawberries, which contrasts with the strict commercial practices she encountered while working on a farm.基默勒是波塔瓦托米部落的成員，她反思了自己在兩個截然不同的世界中的成長經歷：她的美洲原住民傳統和現代美國社會。 這種二元性揭示了重大的文化衝突，特別是在如何看待和對待自然方面。 雖然基默勒的部落實行禮物經濟——大自然的饋贈會帶來感激和回報——但現代社會常常將大自然視為一種商品。 這種差異可以透過基默勒的童年經歷來說明，例如她對野草莓的熱愛，這與她在農場工作時遇到的嚴格商業慣例形成鮮明對比。

# The Decline of Sweetgrass甜草的衰落

The sacred plant sweetgrass serves as a poignant symbol of the struggles faced by Native Americans. Once abundant, sweetgrass is now threatened by invasive European species, mirroring the displacement of indigenous tribes during colonization. Kimmerer draws parallels between the decline of sweetgrass and the historical trauma experienced by her people, emphasizing the need to restore both the land and the cultural practices that honor it. The loss of sweetgrass is not just an ecological issue; it represents a deeper cultural and spiritual loss that must be addressed through a renewed relationship with nature.神聖的植物甜草是美洲原住民所面臨的鬥爭的深刻象徵。 曾經豐富的甜草現在受到歐洲入侵物種的威脅，這反映了殖民時期土著部落的流離失所。 基默勒將甜草的衰落與她的人民經歷的歷史創傷進行了比較，強調需要恢復這片土地和尊重它的文化習俗。 甜草的消失不僅是生態問題，也是生態問題。 它代表了更深層的文化和精神損失，必須透過重建與自然的關係來解決。

# Gratitude and Reciprocity感恩與互惠

Central to Kimmerer's philosophy is the idea that humanity's relationship with nature should be rooted in gratitude and reciprocity. She discusses the concept of reciprocity as a cycle of giving and receiving, which is essential for sustainable living. This cycle is exemplified in the teachings of Paula Gunn, who describes the stages of a woman's life as a metaphor for the interconnectedness of all beings. Kimmerer illustrates this principle through her personal experiences, such as her efforts to clean a polluted pond, demonstrating how caring for the environment can lead to mutual benefits for both nature and humanity.基默勒哲學的核心是人類與自然的關係應該植根於感恩和互惠。 她討論了互惠的概念，即給予和接受的循環，這對於永續生活至關重要。 這個循環在保拉·古恩的教導中得到了例證，她將女性生命的各個階段描述為所有生物相互聯繫的隱喻。 基默勒透過她的個人經驗（例如她清理受污染的池塘的努力）解釋了這項原則，展示了愛護環境如何能為自然和人類帶來互惠互利。

# Sustainable Practices永續實踐

Kimmerer advocates for a harmonious approach to sustainability, drawing on traditional Native American practices. She critiques modern agricultural methods that prioritize profit over ecological balance, contrasting them with the honorable harvest practiced by her ancestors. This method emphasizes taking only what is necessary and leaving enough for nature to regenerate. Kimmerer argues that adopting such sustainable practices is crucial for the health of the planet and future generations.基默勒提倡借鏡美國原住民的傳統做法，採用和諧的方式實現永續發展。 她批評了將利潤置於生態平衡之上的現代農業方法，並將其與她祖先所實現的光榮收成進行了對比。 這種方法強調只取必要的東西，並留下足夠的東西讓大自然再生。 基默勒認為，採用這種永續的做法對於地球和子孫後代的健康至關重要。

# Traditional Knowledge and Education傳統知識與教育

Kimmerer’s dual role as a professor of environmental biology and a member of the Pottawatomie tribe allows her to blend scientific knowledge with indigenous teachings. She shares her experiences in the classroom, where she incorporates traditional agricultural techniques, such as the Three Sisters planting method, to engage students. This approach not only enhances their understanding of ecology but also fosters a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of all life.基默勒作為環境生物學教授和波特瓦托米部落成員的雙重角色使她能夠將科學知識與原住民教義融為一體。 她在課堂上分享自己的經驗，結合傳統農業技術，例如三姊妹種植法，吸引學生。 這種方法不僅增強了他們對生態學的理解，而且加深了對所有生命相互連結的認識。

# Instilling Values in Future Generations向後代灌輸價值觀

To combat environmental degradation and climate change, Kimmerer emphasizes the importance of instilling values of gratitude and respect in the next generation. She proposes a shift in educational practices, suggesting that children should begin each day with a pledge of gratitude to nature. This simple act could cultivate a sense of responsibility and connection to the environment, encouraging future generations to take action against climate change and environmental destruction.為了應對環境退化和氣候變化，基默勒強調向下一代灌輸感恩和尊重價值觀的重要性。 她建議改變教育實踐，建議孩子們應該以對大自然的感激之情開始每一天。 這個簡單的舉動可以培養責任感和與環境的聯繫，鼓勵子孫後代採取行動應對氣候變遷和環境破壞。

# Conclusion結論

In "Braiding Sweetgrass," Kimmerer presents a compelling argument for the reciprocal relationship between humanity and nature. By treating the environment with the same love and respect we would show to a family member, we can create a sustainable future. The book serves as a call to action, encouraging individuals to engage in practices that honor the gifts of nature, such as planting gardens and participating in local conservation efforts. Ultimately, Kimmerer’s message is clear: to protect our planet, we must learn to give back to it, fostering a relationship built on gratitude and reciprocity.在《編織甜草》中，基默勒為人類與自然的相互關係提出了令人信服的論點。 透過像對待家庭成員一樣對待環境，我們可以創造一個永續的未來。 這本書呼籲採取行動，鼓勵個人參與尊重自然恩賜的實踐，例如種植花園和參與當地的保育工作。 最終，基默勒的訊息很明確：為了保護我們的星球，我們必須學會回饋它，培養建立在感恩和互惠基礎上的關係。

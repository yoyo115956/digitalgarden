# Introduction to Mindset心態簡介

Our mindset significantly influences our beliefs about learning, change, and growth. Carol Dweck's concept of mindset distinguishes between two types: fixed and growth. A fixed mindset leads individuals to believe that their abilities are predetermined and unchangeable, while a growth mindset encourages the belief that effort and perseverance can lead to improvement and mastery in various skills.我們的心態極大地影響著我們對學習、改變和成長的信念。 卡羅爾·德韋克（Carol Dweck）的心態概念區分了兩種類型：固定心態和成長心態。 固定心態使個人相信自己的能力是預先決定的且不可改變的，而成長心態則鼓勵人們相信努力和堅持可以改善和掌握各種技能。

# Understanding Fixed Mindset了解固定型思維模式

Individuals with a fixed mindset view talent as the most important factor in success. They believe that abilities are set in stone, meaning that a person is either naturally gifted or not. This mindset can lead to a lack of motivation to improve since they think that practice won’t change their inherent abilities. In professional settings, such as companies like Enron and McKinsey, this mindset can result in hiring individuals based solely on their perceived talent, leading to a culture where mistakes are not tolerated, and employees are judged harshly.固定型思維模式的人將才能視為成功的最重要因素。 他們相信能力是一成不變的，這意味著一個人要么有天賦，要么沒有天賦。 這種心態可能會導致缺乏改進的動力，因為他們認為練習不會改變他們固有的能力。 在安然和麥肯錫這樣的專業環境中，這種心態可能會導致僅根據個人的才能來僱用個人，從而形成一種不容忍錯誤的文化，並對員工進行嚴厲的評判。

# Characteristics of Growth Mindset成長心態的特徵

In contrast, those with a growth mindset embrace challenges and view difficult tasks as opportunities for learning. Children with a growth mindset are eager to tackle tough problems, believing that their intelligence can grow with effort. They focus on personal development rather than competition with others, finding joy in the process of learning and improving. This mindset fosters resilience, as individuals learn from their failures and seek ways to enhance their skills.相較之下，那些具有成長心態的人會擁抱挑戰，並將困難的任務視為學習的機會。 具有成長心態的孩子渴望解決棘手的問題，相信他們的智力可以透過努力而增長。 他們專注於個人發展而不是與他人競爭，在學習和進步的過程中找到快樂。 這種心態可以培養韌性，因為個人可以從失敗中學習並尋求提高技能的方法。

# Approval vs. Development批准與開發

People with a fixed mindset often seek approval and validation from others, fearing judgment and failure. For instance, Lee Iacocca, a former CEO, exemplified this by prioritizing his image over the company's needs after initial success. On the other hand, leaders like Lou Gerstner, who adopted a growth mindset, focused on teamwork and collaboration, leading to significant improvements in their organizations. This shift from individual success to collective growth can create a more positive and productive work environment.固定型思維模式的人常常尋求他人的認同和認可，害怕別人的評判和失敗。 例如，前執行長李·艾柯卡(Lee Iacocca) 證明了這一點，在取得初步成功後，他將自己的形象置於公司需求之上。 另一方面，像郭士納這樣的領導者採用了成長型思維，並專注於團隊合作和協作，從而使組織取得了顯著的進步。 這種從個人成功到集體成長的轉變可以創造一個更積極和更有生產力的工作環境。

# Perception of Failure對失敗的看法

Failure is perceived very differently between the two mindsets. Those with a fixed mindset see failure as a disaster, leading to feelings of inadequacy and avoidance of challenges. For example, golfer Sergio Garcia reacted to failures with anger and blame, while Michael Jordan exemplified a growth mindset by analyzing his mistakes and practicing diligently to improve. This ability to view failure as a learning opportunity is crucial for personal and professional growth.兩種心態對失敗的看法截然不同。 那些具有固定型思維模式的人將失敗視為一場災難，導致他們感到自己能力不足並迴避挑戰。 例如，高爾夫球手塞爾吉奧·加西亞(Sergio Garcia) 對失敗的反應是憤怒和責備，而邁克爾·喬丹(Michael Jordan) 通過分析自己的錯誤並努力練習以提高自己，從而體現了成長心態。 這種將失敗視為學習機會的能力對於個人和職業成長至關重要。

# Embracing Challenges迎接挑戰

Individuals with a growth mindset actively seek out challenges, viewing them as chances to grow rather than risks to avoid. They understand that effort is necessary for achievement and are willing to face difficulties head-on. For instance, Christopher Reeve, after a life-altering accident, refused to accept his limitations and worked tirelessly to regain his abilities, demonstrating the power of a growth mindset in overcoming obstacles.具有成長心態的人積極尋找挑戰，將其視為成長的機會，而不是需要避免的風險。 他們明白要取得成功就必須付出努力，願意麵對困難。 例如，克里斯多福·李維（Christopher Reeve）在經歷了一次改變生活的事故後，拒絕接受自己的局限性，並不知疲倦地努力恢復自己的能力，展示了成長心態在克服障礙方面的力量。

# Influence of Role Models榜樣的影響力

The development of mindset often begins in childhood and is heavily influenced by role models, particularly parents and teachers. Children raised by parents who encourage growth and learning are more likely to adopt a growth mindset. Conversely, those with parents who focus on labeling abilities may develop a fixed mindset. Educators also play a vital role; teachers who believe in their students’ potential can inspire a growth mindset, leading to improved performance and self-esteem.心態的發展通常從童年開始，並深受榜樣的影響，尤其是父母和老師。 鼓勵成長和學習的父母撫養的孩子更有可能採取成長心態。 相反，那些父母注重貼標籤能力的人可能會形成固定型思維模式。 教育工作者也發揮著至關重要的作用； 相信學生潛力的教師可以激發學生的成長心態，從而提高表現和自尊。

# Adopting a Growth Mindset採用成長心態

It is possible for anyone to cultivate a growth mindset, regardless of their background. This involves recognizing fixed thoughts and consciously shifting to a growth-oriented perspective. For example, instead of labeling oneself as clumsy after dropping a plate, one can acknowledge the mistake and focus on being more careful next time. This shift can lead to greater resilience and a willingness to seek help and learn from others.任何人都有可能培養成長型思維，無論其背景為何。 這涉及到認識到固定的想法並有意識地轉向以成長為導向的觀點。 例如，人們可以承認錯誤並集中精力下次更加小心，而不是在丟掉盤子後給自己貼上笨拙的標籤。 這種轉變可以帶來更大的適應力以及尋求幫助和向他人學習的意願。

# Conclusion結論

In summary, the key takeaway from Carol Dweck's work on mindset is that a fixed mindset can hinder personal development, while a growth mindset fosters resilience and the pursuit of potential. By challenging our beliefs and attitudes, we can cultivate a growth mindset that allows us to embrace learning and improvement in all areas of life. This mindset is essential for achieving self-fulfillment and making the impossible possible.總之，卡羅爾·德韋克（Carol Dweck）關於心態的研究的主要收穫是，固定心態會阻礙個人發展，而成長心態則可以培養韌性和對潛力的追求。 透過挑戰我們的信念和態度，我們可以培養成長心態，使我們能夠在生活的各個領域中學習和改進。 這種心態對於實現自我實現和化不可能為可能至關重要。

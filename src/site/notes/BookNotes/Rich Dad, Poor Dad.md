# Introduction介紹

The quest for financial education is often overlooked in traditional upbringing and schooling. Many parents advise their children to pursue academic excellence and secure employment, but this advice may not lead to financial success. Instead, the knowledge necessary to achieve wealth is often passed down through wealthy families. In "Rich Dad, Poor Dad," Robert Kiyosaki shares valuable lessons about money and wealth accumulation, emphasizing the importance of financial education.在傳統的教育和教育中，對金融教育的追求常常被忽略。 許多父母建議他們的孩子追求卓越的學業並找到工作，但這種建議可能不會帶來經濟上的成功。 相反，實現財富所需的知識往往是透過富裕家庭傳承下來的。 在《富爸爸，窮爸爸》中，羅伯特清崎分享了有關金錢和財富累積的寶貴經驗，強調了金融教育的重要性。

# Rich People Don’t Work for Money有錢人不為錢工作

Kiyosaki recounts his childhood experiences with two father figures: his biological father, whom he refers to as "Poor Dad," and his friend Mike's father, "Rich Dad." While Poor Dad advocated for traditional education and stable employment, Rich Dad taught Kiyosaki that working for money is not the path to wealth. Instead, the rich focus on making their money work for them. This lesson was reinforced when Kiyosaki worked for Rich Dad for a meager wage, only to realize that the experience was more valuable than the money itself.清崎講述了他與兩個父親形象的童年經歷：他的親生父親，他稱之為“窮爸爸”，以及他的朋友邁克的父親，“富爸爸”。 窮爸爸提倡傳統教育和穩定就業，而富爸爸卻告訴清崎，為錢工作並不是致富之路。 相反，富人專注於讓錢為他們工作。 當清崎以微薄的工資為富爸爸工作時，這一教訓得到了強化，但他意識到這種經歷比金錢本身更有價值。

# Educate Yourself About Finances自學財務知識

The distinction between assets and liabilities is crucial for financial success. Rich Dad explained that assets are things that put money in your pocket, while liabilities take money out. Many people mistakenly consider their homes as assets, but Kiyosaki argues that they are often liabilities due to mortgages and ongoing expenses. The wealthy invest in true assets that generate income, allowing them to build wealth over time.資產和負債之間的區別對於財務成功至關重要。 富爸爸解釋說，資產是把錢放進你口袋的東西，而負債則是把錢拿出來的東西。 許多人錯誤地將自己的房屋視為資產，但清崎認為，由於抵押貸款和持續支出，房屋往往是負債。 富人投資於能產生收入的真正資產，使他們能夠隨著時間的推移累積財富。

# Mind Your Own Business管好自己的事

Kiyosaki emphasizes the importance of focusing on personal financial growth rather than solely relying on a job for income. While having a job is necessary, it is essential to develop a portfolio of assets that generate passive income. Kiyosaki learned to "mind his own business" by investing in income-producing assets, which ultimately led to his financial success. This approach allows individuals to create wealth independent of their employment.清崎強調專注於個人財務成長而不是僅僅依靠工作來獲取收入的重要性。 雖然有工作是必要的，但開發能產生被動收入的資產組合也很重要。 清崎學會了透過投資創收資產來“管好自己的事”，這最終導致了他的財務成功。 這種方法允許個人獨立於其就業而創造財富。

# Understanding the Tax Code了解稅法

Rich Dad taught Kiyosaki that the wealthy leverage their understanding of the tax code and legal systems to protect their wealth. Unlike the middle class, who are taxed on their income before spending, the rich can spend pre-tax dollars through corporations, allowing them to minimize their tax burden. This strategic approach enables the wealthy to retain more of their earnings and invest them back into their businesses or assets.富爸爸告訴清崎，富人利用他們對稅法和法律制度的理解來保護他們的財富。 與中產階級在支出前先對收入徵稅不同，富人可以透過公司支出稅前美元，從而最大限度地減少稅收負擔。 這種策略方法使富人能夠保留更多的收入，並將其投資回自己的企業或資產。

# The Lack of Financial Education缺乏理財教育

Kiyosaki highlights the lack of financial education in traditional schooling, which leaves many individuals ill-equipped to manage their finances. He points out that even well-educated adults often make poor financial decisions due to a lack of understanding of concepts like saving, investing, and compound interest. This gap in financial literacy can lead to significant challenges, including inadequate retirement planning.清崎強調傳統學校教育缺乏金融教育，這導致許多人缺乏管理財務的能力。 他指出，即使是受過良好教育的成年人也常常因為缺乏對儲蓄、投資和複利等概念的理解而做出糟糕的財務決策。 金融知識方面的這種差距可能會帶來重大挑戰，包括退休計畫不足。

# Steps to Financial Education財商教育步驟

To achieve financial success, Kiyosaki outlines three essential steps: assess your current financial situation, set realistic financial goals, and build financial intelligence. By evaluating their finances honestly, individuals can identify areas for improvement and set achievable goals. Additionally, investing in financial education—through classes, books, and networking—can equip individuals with the knowledge needed to make informed financial decisions.為了實現財務成功，清崎概述了三個基本步驟：評估當前的財務狀況、設定切合實際的財務目標以及建立財務智慧。 透過誠實地評估自己的財務狀況，個人可以確定需要改進的領域並設定可實現的目標。 此外，投資於金融教育——透過課程、書籍和人脈——可以讓個人掌握做出明智的財務決策所需的知識。

# Financial Intelligence and Courage財務智慧和勇氣

Kiyosaki emphasizes that financial intelligence is not just about knowledge; it also requires courage to take risks. Many individuals miss out on opportunities due to fear of failure or societal disapproval. The wealthy are often those who are willing to take calculated risks and seize opportunities when they arise. By combining knowledge with courage, individuals can create their own financial luck and success.清崎強調，財商不只是知識，更是知識。 它還需要敢於冒險的勇氣。 許多人由於害怕失敗或社會的反對而錯過了機會。 富人往往是那些願意承擔經過計算的風險並在機會出現時抓住機會的人。 透過將知識與勇氣結合，個人可以創造自己的財務運氣和成功。

# Investing Wisely明智投資

Taking risks in investments is essential for wealth accumulation. Kiyosaki encourages individuals to consider investing in stocks, bonds, or real estate rather than keeping their money in low-interest savings accounts. While these investments carry risks, they also offer the potential for higher returns. The key is to be willing to take calculated risks to achieve greater financial rewards.承擔投資風險對於財富累積至關重要。 清崎鼓勵個人考慮投資股票、債券或房地產，而不是將錢存在低利率儲蓄帳戶中。 雖然這些投資存在風險，但它們也提供了獲得更高回報的潛力。 關鍵是願意承擔經過計算的風險以獲得更大的經濟回報。

# Work to Learn, Not Just to Earn工作是為了學習，而不僅僅是為了賺錢

Finally, Kiyosaki stresses the importance of seeking knowledge and experience over merely earning a paycheck. He shares his own journey of leaving a stable job to pursue opportunities that would teach him valuable skills. By working in various roles and industries, he gained a broad base of knowledge that ultimately contributed to his financial success. This approach contrasts with the traditional notion of specialization, which may not always lead to wealth.最後，清崎強調了尋求知識和經驗而不是僅僅賺取薪水的重要性。 他分享了自己離開穩定工作去尋找能夠教會他寶貴技能的機會的經驗。 透過在不同的職位和行業工作，他獲得了廣泛的知識基礎，最終促成了他的財務成功。 這種方法與傳統的專業化概念形成鮮明對比，傳統的專業化概念可能無法總是帶來財富。

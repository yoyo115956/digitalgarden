# Introduction to Disruptive Innovation顛覆性創新簡介

Disruptive innovation is a pivotal concept in economics, introduced by Clayton Christensen in his influential book, "The Innovator's Dilemma." This idea has gained lasting significance, particularly as it explains how new technologies can disrupt established markets and companies. Christensen's work has been recognized by prominent figures in the business world, highlighting its relevance in understanding economic shifts and the dynamics of innovation.顛覆性創新是經濟學中的關鍵概念，由克萊頓·克里斯滕森（Clayton Christensen）在其頗具影響力的著作《創新者的困境》中提出。 這個想法具有持久的意義，特別是因為它解釋了新技術如何擾亂現有市場和公司。 克里斯滕森的工作得到了商界知名人士的認可，強調了其在理解經濟變化和創新動態方面的相關性。

# Historical Context of Disruptive Innovation顛覆性創新的歷史背景

The notion of disruptive innovation can be traced back to Joseph Schumpeter's idea of "creative destruction," which posits that destruction can be beneficial for economic advancement. Christensen expanded on this concept in the late 20th century, particularly with the rise of technology and changing consumer behaviors. His book, published in 1997, accurately predicted the transformative impact of innovation in the coming millennium, exemplified by companies like Uber and Amazon, which have disrupted traditional industries.顛覆性創新的概念可以追溯到約瑟夫·熊彼特的「創造性破壞」思想，認為破壞有利於經濟進步。 克里斯滕森在 20 世紀末擴展了這個概念，特別是隨著科技的興起和消費者行為的改變。 他於 1997 年出版的書準確地預測了創新在即將到來的千年中帶來的變革性影響，Uber 和亞馬遜等顛覆傳統行業的公司就是例證。

# The Story of Sony and the Radio Market索尼和廣播市場的故事

To illustrate disruptive innovation, Christensen recounts the story of Sony in the 1950s. During a time of economic prosperity in the U.S., established companies like RCA and Zenith dominated the radio market with high-quality, expensive products. However, Sony, a small Japanese firm, entered the market with a low-cost, portable transistor radio that appealed to teenagers who could not afford the high-end models. This strategy allowed Sony to capture a new market segment, ultimately leading to its dominance in the radio industry as the quality of its products improved over time.為了說明顛覆性創新，克里斯滕森講述了 20 世紀 50 年代索尼的故事。 在美國經濟繁榮時期，RCA 和 Zenith 等老牌公司憑藉高品質、昂貴的產品主導了無線電市場。 然而，日本小公司索尼以低成本便攜式晶體管收音機進入市場，吸引了買不起高端型號的青少年。 這項策略使索尼佔領了一個新的細分市場，隨著產品品質的不斷提高，最終使其在無線電產業中佔據主導地位。

# The Role of Established Companies已成立公司的作用

Christensen argues that established companies often fail to capitalize on breakthrough technologies, even when they are developed within their own R&D departments. This failure is not due to a lack of innovation but rather because these new technologies often start as inferior products. For instance, Kodak developed the first digital camera but did not pursue it aggressively because it did not meet the high standards of their existing film products. As a result, they lost their market position to new entrants who embraced the disruptive technology.克里斯滕森認為，老牌公司往往無法利用突破性技術，即使這些技術是在自己的研發部門內開發的。 這種失敗並不是因為缺乏創新，而是因為這些新技術往往是劣質產品。 例如，柯達開發了第一台數位相機，但並沒有積極追求它，因為它不符合其現有膠片產品的高標準。 結果，他們失去了市場地位，輸給了接受顛覆性技術的新進者。

# Understanding the Dilemma了解困境

The crux of the innovator's dilemma lies in the challenge faced by established companies when confronted with disruptive innovations. Managers tend to focus on sustaining innovations that enhance existing products, leading to complacency. They often overlook low-quality innovations that could potentially create new markets. This creates a situation where by the time these companies recognize the value of disruptive innovations, it is too late to reclaim their market share.創新者困境的癥結在於老牌企業在面對顛覆性創新時所面臨的挑戰。 管理者往往專注於增強現有產品的持續創新，從而導致自滿。 他們經常忽略可能創造新市場的低品質創新。 這就造成了這樣一種情況：當這些公司意識到顛覆性創新的價值時，想要奪回市佔率就為時已晚。

# Case Study: Gillette案例研究：吉列

Gillette serves as a contemporary example of the innovator's dilemma. The company has continually improved its razors, adding features and complexity that appeal to existing customers. However, new entrants like Dollar Shave Club have identified a market for simpler, more affordable products. By offering direct-to-consumer delivery, these companies have disrupted Gillette's traditional business model, forcing it to confront the reality of changing consumer preferences.吉列是創新者困境的當代例子。 該公司不斷改進其刮鬍刀，增加吸引現有客戶的功能和複雜性。 然而，像 Dollar Shave Club 這樣的新進業者已經找到了更簡單、更實惠的產品市場。 透過提供直接面向消費者的送貨服務，這些公司顛覆了吉列的傳統商業模式，迫使其面對消費者偏好不斷變化的現實。

# Conclusion: Navigating the Innovator's Dilemma結論：解決創新者的困境

The innovator's dilemma presents a significant challenge for established companies. While it is uncertain whether Gillette can successfully adapt to the changing landscape, the key takeaway from Christensen's work is the importance of recognizing and nurturing new ideas before they become threats. Business leaders must learn to embrace fear as a motivator for innovation and adaptability, ensuring that they do not fall victim to the pitfalls of complacency. Christensen's legacy lies in his ability to instill this understanding in a generation of business leaders, emphasizing the need for proactive strategies in the face of disruptive change.創新者的困境為老牌公司帶來了重大挑戰。 雖然吉列能否成功適應不斷變化的情況尚不確定，但克里斯滕森的工作的主要收穫是在新想法成為威脅之前識別和培育它們的重要性。 企業領導者必須學會將恐懼視為創新和適應的動力，確保他們不會陷入自滿的陷阱。 克里斯滕森的遺產在於他能夠向一代商業領袖灌輸這種理解，強調面對顛覆性變革需要採取積極主動的策略。

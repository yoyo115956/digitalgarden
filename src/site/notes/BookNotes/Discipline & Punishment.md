# Introduction介紹

The significance of prisons in society is often overlooked, yet they serve as a crucial lens through which to understand broader social dynamics. Michel Foucault's "Discipline & Punish" explores the evolution of punishment from public spectacles of torture to the modern prison system, revealing deeper societal transformations influenced by Enlightenment ideas and industrialization.監獄在社會中的重要性經常被忽視，但它們是了解更廣泛的社會動態的重要鏡頭。 米歇爾·福柯的《規訓與懲罰》探討了懲罰從公開酷刑到現代監獄系統的演變，揭示了受啟蒙思想和工業化影響的更深層次的社會變革。

# Chapter 1: Transition from Public to Private Punishment第一章：從公共懲罰到私人懲罰的轉變

In the 19th century, punishment shifted from public displays of bodily harm to private, regimented forms targeting the soul. Foucault highlights a pivotal moment in 1757 when Robert-Francois Damiens was gruesomely executed in public, marking the end of such spectacles. By the late 18th century, punishment became more bureaucratic, focusing on the internal transformation of the individual rather than physical suffering. The new penal system emphasized a structured daily routine for prisoners, indicating a shift in the purpose of punishment from physical pain to psychological reform.19世紀，懲罰從公開的身體傷害轉向針對靈魂的私人、嚴格的形式。 傅柯強調了 1757 年的一個關鍵時刻，羅伯特-弗朗索瓦·達米安 (Robert-Francois Damiens) 在公開場合被殘忍處決，標誌著此類奇觀的結束。 到了 18 世紀末，懲罰變得更加官僚化，重點關注個人的內在轉變，而不是身體上的痛苦。 新的刑罰制度強調囚犯的日常生活有條理，這表明懲罰的目的從肉體痛苦轉向心理改造。

# Chapter 2: The Role of Torture and Sovereign Power第二章：酷刑和主權的作用

The transition in punishment methods was not arbitrary; it stemmed from Enlightenment critiques of torture, which was once a scientific and systematic approach to extracting confessions. Torture was integral to both punishment and investigation, reinforcing the sovereign's power through public executions that served as demonstrations of authority. The spectacle of punishment was a means for the sovereign to assert control, with public executions acting as a reminder of the state's power over life and death.懲罰方式的轉變不是任意的； 它源自於啟蒙運動對酷刑的批評，酷刑曾經是一種科學、有系統的刑求方法。 酷刑是懲罰和調查不可或缺的一部分，透過公開處決來增強主權的權力，以展示權威。 懲罰的場面是主權者維護控制的手段，公開處決提醒人民國家對生死的權力。

# Chapter 3: Criminality as a Societal Illness第三章：犯罪是一種社會弊病

By the end of the 18th century, societal views on crime began to evolve. Criminal acts were increasingly seen as offenses against society rather than solely against the sovereign. This shift necessitated a new approach to punishment that emphasized humanity and sought to understand the motivations behind criminal behavior. Investigations transformed into a scientific endeavor, with psychiatrists and psychologists playing a role in determining appropriate punishment, reflecting a broader societal concern for the collective well-being.到 18 世紀末，社會對犯罪的看法開始演變。 犯罪行為越來越被視為對社會的侵犯，而不僅僅是對主權的侵犯。 這種轉變需要一種新的懲罰方法，強調人性並試圖理解犯罪行為背後的動機。 調查轉變為科學事業，精神病學家和心理學家在確定適當的懲罰方面發揮作用，反映了社會對集體福祉的更廣泛關注。

# Chapter 4: Restructuring of Disciplinary Concepts第四章 學科觀念重構

The 17th and 18th centuries marked a radical restructuring of disciplinary concepts. Punishment was no longer about public examples but about transforming individuals into compliant members of society. This involved spatial organization, control of activities through timetables, and the molding of individual identities through structured tasks. The goal was to integrate individuals into the industrial machine, emphasizing their roles as productive members of society.17 世紀和 18 世紀標誌著學科概念的徹底重組。 懲罰不再是為了公開榜樣，而是為了將個人轉變為順從的社會成員。 這涉及空間組織、透過時間表控制活動以及透過結構化任務來塑造個人身份。 目標是將個人融入工業機器，強調他們作為社會生產成員的角色。

# Chapter 5: Principles of Disciplinary Power第五章：紀律權力的原則

Foucault identifies three principles underpinning disciplinary power: hierarchical observation, normalizing judgment, and examination. Hierarchical observation involves constant surveillance, where individuals are monitored by one another within a structured hierarchy. Normalizing judgment establishes standards for behavior, leading to a system of assessment and ranking. Examination reduces individuals to cases, subjecting them to continuous scrutiny in institutions like hospitals and schools, reinforcing societal norms.傅柯提出了支持紀律權力的三個原則：等級觀察、規範判斷和檢查。 分層觀察涉及持續的監視，其中個體在結構化的分層結構中受到彼此的監視。 規範化判斷建立了行為標準，從而形成了評估和排名系統。 檢查將個人簡化為病例，使他們在醫院和學校等機構中接受持續的審查，從而強化社會規範。

# Chapter 6: The Panopticon and Surveillance第6章：圓形監獄和監視

The concept of the Panopticon, proposed by Jeremy Bentham, illustrates how discipline is maintained through the constant feeling of surveillance. The design of the Panopticon allows inmates to feel perpetually watched, encouraging self-regulation and compliance. This model of control emerged during times of crisis, such as the plague, demonstrating how societal fears can lead to refined systems of surveillance and governance.傑里米·邊沁 (Jeremy Bentham) 提出的圓形監獄的概念說明瞭如何透過持續的監視感來維持紀律。 圓形監獄的設計讓囚犯感到永遠受到監視，鼓勵自我調節和服從。 這種控制模式出現在瘟疫等危機時期，展示了社會恐懼如何導致完善的監視和治理系統。

# Chapter 7: Prisons as Tools of Discipline第七章：監獄作為紀律工具

Prisons emerged as a primary form of punishment in the 19th century, representing a means to deprive individuals of liberty while also offering opportunities for moral improvement. The isolation of prisoners was intended to foster remorse and self-reflection, while prison labor aimed to integrate them into the industrial workforce. However, Foucault questions the efficacy of this forced labor, suggesting that it primarily served to condition individuals to fit into the industrial system rather than genuinely rehabilitate them.監獄作為 19 世紀的主要懲罰形式出現，是剝奪個人自由的一種手段，同時也提供了道德提高的機會。 隔離囚犯的目的是培養悔恨和自我反省，而監獄勞動的目的是讓他們融入工業勞動力。 然而，傅柯質疑這種強迫勞動的有效性，認為它主要是為了讓個人適應工業體系，而不是真正使他們康復。

# Conclusion: The Evolution of Punishment結論：懲罰的演變

Foucault's analysis reveals that by the end of the 18th century, punishment had transformed from a focus on the body to an emphasis on the soul. The criminal became a part of the social machine, with surveillance and discipline becoming integral to societal order. This evolution reflects broader changes in societal values and structures, highlighting the complex relationship between power, punishment, and individual identity in the context of modernity.傅柯的分析表明，到18世紀末，懲罰已經從注重身體轉變為強調靈魂。 罪犯成為社會機器的一部分，監視和紀律成為社會秩序的組成部分。 這種演變反映了社會價值觀和結構的更廣泛變化，凸顯了現代性背景下權力、懲罰和個人認同之間的複雜關係。

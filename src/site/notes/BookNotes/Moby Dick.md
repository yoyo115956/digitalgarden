# Introduction to Moby Dick《莫比迪克》簡介

Moby Dick, written by Herman Melville and published in 1851, is a classic tale that explores themes of revenge and its tragic consequences. Despite its initial lack of success, the novel has since gained recognition as one of the great American novels, praised by authors such as D. H. Lawrence and William Faulkner. The narrative is characterized by its unique style, which includes a mix of prose, stage play, and detailed digressions about whaling and marine biology. The story is narrated by Ishmael, who provides a philosophical and humorous perspective on his adventures aboard the whaling ship Pequod.《白鯨》由赫爾曼·梅爾維爾 (Herman Melville) 撰寫，於 1851 年出版，是一部探討復仇主題及其悲劇後果的經典故事。 儘管最初並未取得成功，這部小說後來被公認為美國最偉大的小說之一，並受到 D. H. 勞倫斯和威廉·福克納等作家的稱讚。 敘事風格獨特，融合了散文、舞台劇以及有關捕鯨和海洋生物學的詳細題外話。 這個故事由以實瑪利講述，他以哲學和幽默的視角講述了他在佩闊德號捕鯨船上的冒險經歷。

# Chapter 1: Ishmael and Queequeg Find a Job第一章：以實瑪利和奎奎格找到工作

The story begins with Ishmael, a young sailor seeking work on a whaling ship. He travels from New York to Nantucket, where he meets Queequeg, a tattooed harpooner from the South Sea Islands. Their initial encounter is marked by fear and confusion, but they quickly become close friends. Ishmael's character is complex; while he presents himself as a simple sailor, he is actually knowledgeable and philosophical, reflecting on his experiences and the people he meets. After spending time in New Bedford, Ishmael and Queequeg decide to sign up for a voyage on the Pequod, a whaling ship captained by the enigmatic Ahab.故事開始於以實瑪利（Ishmael），一位年輕的水手在捕鯨船上尋找工作。 他從紐約前往楠塔基特島，在那裡他遇到了來自南海群島的紋身魚叉手奎奎格。 他們最初的相遇充滿了恐懼和困惑，但他們很快就成為了親密的朋友。 以實瑪利的性格很複雜。 雖然他把自己描繪成一個簡單的水手，但實際上他知識淵博，富有哲理，反思自己的經歷和遇到的人。 在新貝德福德待了一段時間後，以實瑪利和奎奎格決定報名參加佩闊德號的航行，這是一艘由神秘的亞哈船長駕駛的捕鯨船。

# Chapter 2: Ahab’s Reward第2章：亞哈的獎賞

Captain Ahab's presence is felt long before he appears on deck, and when he finally does, he reveals his singular obsession: Moby Dick, the great white whale that took his leg and scarred his face. Ahab's desire for revenge drives the narrative forward, as he offers a gold doubloon as a reward for the first crew member to spot the whale. While most of the crew is excited by Ahab's promise, Starbuck, the first mate, expresses concern over Ahab's reckless pursuit of vengeance, which jeopardizes the ship's mission to hunt whales for profit. The narrative shifts between Ahab's obsession and Ishmael's curiosity about whales, highlighting the contrasting perspectives of destruction and understanding.亞哈船長早在他出現在甲板上之前就已經感受到了他的存在，當他最終出現時，他揭示了他獨特的痴迷：莫比迪克，那條大白鯨咬住了他的腿，在他的臉上留下了疤痕。 亞哈的復仇慾望推動了故事的發展，他向第一個發現鯨魚的船員提供了金幣作為獎勵。 雖然大多數船員都對亞哈的承諾感到興奮，但大副斯塔巴克對亞哈魯莽的復仇行為表示擔憂，這危及了該船捕鯨以獲取利潤的使命。 敘述在亞哈對鯨魚的執著和以實瑪利對鯨魚的好奇之間轉變，突顯了破壞和理解的對比視角。

# Chapter 3: The Lone Survivor第3章：孤獨的倖存者

As the Pequod sails further into the ocean, Ahab's fixation on Moby Dick leads to a series of disastrous encounters. Despite warnings from other whaling ships, Ahab remains relentless in his pursuit. The climax occurs during three intense chases with Moby Dick, each resulting in destruction and loss. Ultimately, the Pequod is rammed by the whale, leading to its sinking. Ishmael survives by clinging to Queequeg's coffin, which had been made during a previous illness. He is eventually rescued by the ship Rachel, becoming the sole survivor of the ill-fated voyage.當「裴闊德號」駛向更遠的海洋時，亞哈對白鯨的迷戀導致了一系列災難性的遭遇。 儘管其他捕鯨船發出警告，亞哈仍然堅持不懈地追捕。 高潮發生在與莫比迪克的三場激烈追逐中，每場都造成破壞和損失。 最終，「裴闊德號」被鯨魚撞擊而沉沒。 以實瑪利靠著魁魁格的棺材活了下來，這口棺材是在上次生病時製作的。 他最終被雷切爾號救起，成為這次不幸的航行中唯一的倖存者。

# Introduction介紹

Jim Collins' book "Good to Great" explores how companies can transition from being merely good to achieving greatness. Building on his previous work, "Built to Last," Collins investigates what differentiates great companies from their mediocre counterparts. His research involved studying three groups of public U.S. companies over five years, focusing on those that made the leap to greatness, those that remained mediocre, and those that briefly achieved greatness before falling back. The goal was to identify the unique strategies and practices that enabled certain companies to excel.吉姆‧柯林斯 (Jim Collins) 的《從優秀到卓越》一書探討了公司如何從僅僅優秀轉變為實現卓越。 柯林斯以他先前的著作《基業長青》為基礎，研究了偉大公司與平庸同行的差異。 他的研究涉及五年內對三組美國上市公司的研究，重點是那些一躍成為偉大公司的公司、那些仍然平庸的公司以及那些在回落之前短暫取得偉大成就的公司。 目標是確定使某些公司脫穎而出的獨特策略和實踐。

# Finding Your “Hedgehog Concept”找到你的“刺蝟理念”

A central theme in Collins' research is the "hedgehog concept," which serves as a guiding principle for companies. This concept is derived from an analogy where a hedgehog, despite being pursued by a cunning fox, survives by sticking to a simple strategy: curling up into a ball. Good to great companies identify their own hedgehog concept by answering three critical questions: What can we be the best in the world at? What are we passionate about? What are the key economic indicators we should focus on? By aligning their decisions with this concept, companies can maintain focus and direction, leading to sustained success.柯林斯研究的中心主題是“刺蝟概念”，它是企業的指導原則。 這個概念源自於一個類比：一隻刺蝟儘管被狡猾的狐狸追趕，但仍堅持一個簡單的策略：蜷縮成一個球，從而生存下來。 從優秀到卓越的公司透過回答三個關鍵問題來確定自己的刺蝟理念：我們能在什麼方面成為世界上最好的？ 我們熱衷於什麼？ 我們應該重點關注哪些關鍵經濟指標？ 透過根據這個概念做出決策，公司可以保持重點和方向，從而取得持續的成功。

# Success Through Incremental Progress循序漸進取得成功

Collins emphasizes that the journey from good to great is not marked by dramatic changes but rather by a series of small, incremental improvements. Companies often do not realize they are transforming until they see the results of their consistent efforts. This gradual momentum is likened to pushing a flywheel, where each small push contributes to a larger breakthrough. For instance, Nucor, a steel manufacturer, achieved remarkable success by consistently focusing on its strategy of using mini mills, ultimately becoming the most profitable steel company in the U.S.柯林斯強調，從優秀到卓越的旅程並不是以巨大的變化為標誌，而是以一系列微小的、漸進的改進為標誌。 公司通常不會意識到自己正在轉型，直到看到持續努力的結果。 這種漸進的動力就像推動飛輪一樣，每一次小小的推動都會帶來更大的突破。 例如，鋼鐵製造商紐柯公司透過持續專注於使用小型鋼廠的策略取得了顯著的成功，最終成為美國最賺錢的鋼鐵公司。

# Technology as an Accelerator技術作為加速器

In the context of technology, Collins argues that successful companies view it as an accelerator toward their goals rather than a goal in itself. Good to great companies adopt technology that aligns with their overarching strategy, while comparison companies often scramble to adopt new technologies without a clear plan. Walgreens exemplifies this approach by strategically integrating online services to enhance customer convenience, ultimately outperforming competitors who rushed into e-commerce without a coherent strategy.在技術背景下，柯林斯認為，成功的公司將其視為實現目標的加速器，而不是目標本身。 從優秀到卓越的公司採用與其整體策略一致的技術，而對照公司往往在沒有明確計劃的情況下爭先恐後地採用新技術。 沃爾格林透過策略性地整合線上服務來提高客戶便利性，最終超越了那些在沒有連貫策略的情況下匆忙進入電子商務的競爭對手，這就是這種方法的例證。

# The Role of Level 5 Leaders5 級領導者的角色

Collins identifies "level 5 leaders" as a crucial element in the transformation process. These leaders are characterized by their ambition for the company rather than personal ego, demonstrating humility and a focus on long-term success. They prioritize the company's needs over their own recognition. An example is Darwin Smith of Kimberly Clark, who led the company to greatness without seeking personal glory. In contrast, leaders of comparison companies often had inflated egos, leading to poor succession planning and ultimately hindering their organizations' success.柯林斯將「5 級領導者」視為轉型過程中的關鍵要素。 這些領導者的特徵是對公司的抱負而不是個人的自我，表現出謙遜和對長期成功的關注。 他們優先考慮公司的需求而不是自己的認可。 金佰利公司的達爾文史密斯（Darwin Smith）就是一個例子，他帶領公司取得了輝煌，但沒有追求個人榮耀。 相較之下，對照公司的領導者往往自我膨脹，導致繼任計畫不佳，最終阻礙組織的成功。

# Hiring the Right People僱用合適的人

The foundation of greatness lies in having the right people in the right roles. Collins emphasizes the importance of prioritizing character over skills when hiring. Good to great companies focus on getting the right individuals on board and removing those who do not fit the culture, even before defining a clear path forward. This approach fosters an environment where motivated individuals can thrive, as seen in Wells Fargo's success under Dick Cooley's leadership.偉大的基礎在於讓合適的人擔任合適的角色。 柯林斯強調在招募時優先考慮性格而不是技能的重要性。 從優秀到卓越的公司，甚至在確定明確的前進道路之前，都專注於吸引合適的人才加入，並淘汰那些不適合文化的人。 這種方法創造了一個讓積極進取的個人能夠蓬勃發展的環境，正如富國銀行在迪克·庫利 (Dick Cooley) 的領導下取得的成功所體現的那樣。

# Confronting Reality面對現實

Successful companies confront the brutal facts of their situations while maintaining unwavering faith in their ability to prevail. This balance, referred to as the Stockdale Paradox, allows organizations to acknowledge challenges without succumbing to defeatism. For example, while Scott Paper faltered in the face of competition from Procter & Gamble, Kimberly Clark embraced the challenge and ultimately outperformed its rival.成功的公司直面殘酷的事實，同時對自己的勝利能力保持堅定不移的信心。 這種平衡被稱為斯托克代爾悖論，使組織能夠承認挑戰而不屈服於失敗主義。 例如，斯科特紙業公司 (Scott Paper) 在寶潔公司 (Procter & Gamble) 的競爭中舉步維艱，而金佰利公司 (Kimberly Clark) 迎接了挑戰，並最終超越了競爭對手。

# Creating an Open Environment創造開放環境

To confront reality effectively, leaders must foster an environment where harsh truths can be discussed openly. This requires a culture that encourages honest communication and debate, allowing for the airing of difficult facts without fear of retribution. Collins found that good to great companies did not possess more information than their counterparts; they simply dealt with it more honestly.為了有效地面對現實，領導者必須創造一個可以公開討論嚴酷事實的環境。 這需要鼓勵誠實溝通和辯論的文化，允許公開困難的事實而不用擔心遭到報復。 柯林斯發現，從優秀到卓越的公司並不比同業擁有更多的資訊。 他們只是更誠實地處理這件事。

# Fostering Self-Discipline培養自律

Finally, Collins highlights the importance of a culture of rigorous self-discipline to adhere to the hedgehog concept. This discipline is not about authoritarian control but rather about fostering a collective commitment to the company's goals. Good to great companies demonstrate this through their willingness to make sacrifices for the sake of their strategic objectives, as exemplified by Wells Fargo's cost-cutting measures during a period of industry change.最後，柯林斯強調了嚴格自律文化對於堅持刺蝟理念的重要性。 這項紀律不是關於專制控制，而是關於培養對公司目標的集體承諾。 從優秀到卓越的公司透過願意為策略目標做出犧牲來證明這一點，富國銀行在產業變革時期的成本削減措施就是例證。

# Conclusion結論

In summary, "Good to Great" outlines key principles for companies seeking to elevate their performance. The journey from good to great involves developing a clear hedgehog concept, fostering a culture of self-discipline, hiring the right people, and maintaining a commitment to confronting reality. By adhering to these principles, organizations can achieve sustained greatness and outperform their competitors. The essential questions guiding the hedgehog concept—what can we be the best at, what are we passionate about, and what key indicators should we focus on—serve as a roadmap for companies aiming for excellence.總之，「從優秀到卓越」概述了公司尋求提升績效的關鍵原則。 從優秀到卓越的歷程包括制定清晰的刺蝟理念、培養自律文化、僱用合適的人才以及堅持面對現實的承諾。 透過堅持這些原則，組織可以實現持續的卓越並超越競爭對手。 指導刺蝟概念的基本問題——我們能在什麼方面做到最好，我們對什麼充滿熱情，以及我們應該關注哪些關鍵指標——可以作為追求卓越的公司的路線圖。

# Introduction介紹

"Crime and Punishment," a novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, delves into the psychological and spiritual ramifications of crime through the story of Rodion Raskolnikov, a young man living in St. Petersburg. The narrative begins with Raskolnikov in a state of hypochondria, contemplating a grave act that will alter the course of his life. The novel is not merely a mystery but an exploration of the motivations behind Raskolnikov's actions, focusing on the internal conflict he faces as he grapples with his conscience.費奧多爾·陀思妥耶夫斯基的小說《罪與罰》透過居住在聖彼得堡的年輕人羅迪昂·拉斯科爾尼科夫的故事，深入探討了犯罪對心理和精神造成的影響。 故事開始於拉斯柯爾尼科夫處於疑病症狀態，思考著一個將改變他人生軌跡的嚴重行為。 這部小說不僅僅是一個懸疑小說，而且探索了拉斯科爾尼科夫行為背後的動機，重點關注他在與良心作鬥爭時所面臨的內部衝突。

# Before the Crime案發前

Raskolnikov's journey begins in his cramped apartment, where he feels the oppressive heat of the St. Petersburg summer. As he wanders the city, he expresses his belief that cowardice is humanity's greatest hindrance, suggesting that people are capable of great things if only they could overcome their fears. His thoughts lead him to the home of Alena Ivanova, a pawnbroker with whom he has a troubled relationship. During their interaction, Raskolnikov's agitation grows, revealing his inner turmoil and foreshadowing the violent act he is contemplating.拉斯科爾尼科夫的旅程從他狹窄的公寓開始，在那裡他感受到了聖彼得堡夏季令人沮喪的炎熱。 當他在城市中漫步時，他表達了自己的信念，即懦弱是人類最大的障礙，這表明人們只有克服恐懼才能成就偉大的事情。 他的思緒引導他來到了當舖老闆阿琳娜·伊万諾娃 (Alena Ivanova) 的家，他與阿琳娜·伊万諾娃 (Alena Ivanova) 的關係並不好。 在他們的互動中，拉斯柯爾尼科夫的情緒日益激動，暴露出他內心的混亂，並預示著他正在考慮的暴力行為。

In a tavern, Raskolnikov meets Marmeladov, a retired clerk whose tragic story of alcoholism and family suffering further highlights the social issues of the time. Marmeladov's daughter, Sonia, has resorted to prostitution to support her family, illustrating the desperation faced by many in society. This encounter deepens Raskolnikov's character, showcasing his dual nature—his cold, calculating side and his capacity for empathy.在一家小酒館裡，拉斯科爾尼科夫遇到了退休職員馬爾梅拉多夫，他酗酒和家庭苦難的悲慘故事進一步凸顯了當時的社會問題。 馬爾梅拉多夫的女兒索尼婭透過賣淫來養家糊口，這說明了社會上許多人面臨的絕望。 這次遭遇加深了拉斯柯爾尼科夫的性格，展現了他的雙重性格──冷酷、精於算計的一面和同理心的能力。

# The Crime犯罪

The following day, Raskolnikov's anxiety mounts as he prepares to commit murder. After a vivid, disturbing dream about a horse being beaten to death, he awakens with a sense of dread about his intentions. That evening, he steals an axe and confronts Alena Ivanova. In a moment of mechanical detachment, he murders her, but the situation escalates when he unexpectedly kills her sister, Lizaveta, who walks in on the scene. This second murder shatters Raskolnikov's already fragile psyche, marking the beginning of his psychological unraveling.第二天，拉斯科爾尼科夫準備謀殺，他的焦慮加劇。 在做了一個生動而令人不安的夢，夢見一匹馬被打死後，他醒來，對自己的意圖感到恐懼。 那天晚上，他偷了一把斧頭並與阿萊娜·伊凡諾娃對峙。 在機械超然的時刻，他謀殺了她，但當他意外地殺死了走進現場的她的妹妹莉扎維塔時，情況升級了。 這第二起謀殺案粉碎了拉斯科爾尼科夫本已脆弱的心靈，標誌著他心理崩潰的開始。

# The Punishment懲罰

In the aftermath of the murders, Raskolnikov is plagued by guilt and paranoia. He struggles to maintain his composure as he faces the consequences of his actions.

As he interacts with friends and acquaintances, including Razumihin, Raskolnikov's internal conflict becomes more pronounced.

Despite his attempts to connect with others, Raskolnikov remains trapped in a cycle of guilt and self-loathing.當拉斯科爾尼科夫與包括拉祖米欣在內的朋友和熟人交往時，他的內部衝突變得更加明顯。 拉祖米欣代表理性和同情心，與拉斯柯爾尼科夫的自我孤立形成鮮明對比。 儘管拉斯科爾尼科夫嘗試與他人建立聯繫，但他仍然陷入內疚和自我厭惡的循環。

# A Way Out一條出路

Raskolnikov's erratic behavior leads him to confront his guilt in various ways. He semi-confesses to Zametov, the police clerk, but ultimately refrains from fully admitting his crimes. Instead, he seeks redemption through acts of kindness, such as helping Marmeladov's family after the father's tragic death. However, these gestures do not absolve him of his guilt, and he continues to grapple with his conscience.拉斯柯爾尼科夫古怪的行為導致他以各種方式面對自己的罪惡感。 他向警察職員扎梅托夫半供認不諱，但最終沒有完全承認自己的罪行。 相反，他透過善行尋求救贖，例如在父親不幸去世後幫助馬爾梅拉多夫的家人。 然而，這些舉動並不能免除他的罪責，他繼續與自己的良心作鬥爭。

During this time, Raskolnikov meets Sonia, Marmeladov's daughter, who embodies compassion and faith.

# The Extraordinary Man非凡的人

Raskolnikov's philosophical musings come to the forefront during his interactions with Porfiry Petrovich, the head of the investigation. Raskolnikov's theory of the "extraordinary man," which posits that certain individuals are above moral law, is challenged by Porfiry's probing questions. This confrontation forces Raskolnikov to confront the validity of his beliefs and the consequences of his actions.拉斯科尼科夫在與調查負責人波爾菲里·彼得羅維奇的互動中，他的哲學思考成為最重要的。 拉斯柯爾尼科夫的「非凡人」理論認為某些個體凌駕於道德法則之上，而這個理論受到了波爾菲里探索性問題的挑戰。 這種對抗迫使拉斯科爾尼科夫面對他的信念的有效性和他的行為的後果。

As Raskolnikov's mental state continues to deteriorate, he becomes increasingly aware of the futility of his theories. His internal struggle reflects Dostoyevsky's critique of nihilism and the dangers of abandoning moral principles.

# Introduction to Nietzsche's Philosophy尼采哲學導論

Friedrich Nietzsche's "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" is a poetic novel that encapsulates some of his most significant philosophical ideas. The narrative follows Zarathustra, a prophet who descends from solitude in the mountains to share his insights with humanity. Central to his teachings are concepts such as the Übermensch (Overman), the death of God, the will to power, and the quest for meaning in life. Nietzsche's work challenges traditional values and encourages individuals to create their own paths.弗里德里希·尼采的《查拉圖斯特拉如是說》是一部詩意小說，概括了他一些最重要的哲學思想。 故事講述的是一位先知查拉圖斯特拉從孤獨的山中走下來，與人類分享他的見解。 他的教義的核心是超人、上帝之死、權力意誌、對生命意義的追求等概念。 尼采的作品挑戰傳統價值並鼓勵個人創造自己的道路。

# The Path to the Übermensch通往超人之路

The story begins with Zarathustra's return to civilization after ten years of isolation. His first encounter is with an old saint who has renounced the world for God, to which Zarathustra responds with the proclamation that "God is dead." This statement signifies the loss of a universal moral foundation provided by religion. Zarathustra introduces the concept of the Übermensch, representing the pinnacle of human development, where individuals derive meaning from within rather than relying on external authorities.故事開始於查拉圖斯特拉在與世隔絕十年後重返文明社會。 他第一次遇到一位老聖人，他為了上帝而放棄了世界，查拉圖斯特拉對此做出回應，宣布「上帝死了」。 這種說法意味著宗教所提供的普遍道德基礎的喪失。 查拉圖斯特拉引入了「超人」的概念，代表了人類發展的頂峰，個人從內部獲取意義，而不是依賴外部權威。

Zarathustra outlines a three-stage progression toward becoming the Übermensch: the camel (representing self-discipline), the lion (symbolizing independence), and the child (embodying self-creation). He emphasizes that this journey involves struggle and self-overcoming, urging people to embrace life's challenges rather than seeking comfort in mediocrity. Zarathustra warns against becoming the "last men," who are complacent and fearful of their potential.查拉圖斯特拉概述了成為超人的三個階段：駱駝（代表自律）、獅子（象徵獨立）和兒童（體現自我創造）。 他強調，這段旅程涉及鬥爭和自我克服，並敦促人們擁抱生活的挑戰，而不是在平庸中尋求安慰。 查拉圖斯特拉警告不要成為“最後的人”，他們對自己的潛力感到自滿和恐懼。

# The Will to Power權力意志

After facing ridicule in the town of Motley Cow, Zarathustra retreats to reflect on his teachings. He critiques traditional virtues, arguing that true virtue lies in the commitment to one's actions rather than in restraint. He challenges the Christian value of pity, suggesting that it fosters resentment among the powerless. Instead, he advocates for joy and the celebration of life.在莫特利牛鎮遭受嘲笑後，查拉圖斯特拉撤退並反思他的教義。 他批評傳統美德，認為真正的美德在於對自己行為的承諾而不是克制。 他挑戰基督教的憐憫價值觀，認為它會助長弱者的怨恨。 相反，他提倡快樂和慶祝生活。

Zarathustra's philosophy includes a rejection of egalitarianism, viewing it as detrimental to the striving of the Übermensch. He posits that the will to power is a fundamental driving force in life, encouraging individuals to overcome themselves and embrace change. Zarathustra grapples with his role as a philosopher, feeling isolated due to the conflict between truth and popularity. Despite his struggles, he emphasizes the importance of laughter and beauty in life.查拉圖斯特拉的哲學包括對平等主義的拒絕，認為它不利於超人的奮鬥。 他認為權力意志是生活的基本驅動力，鼓勵個人克服自我並擁抱改變。 查拉圖斯特拉努力應對自己作為哲學家的角色，由於真理與流行之間的衝突而感到孤立。 儘管他很掙扎，但他強調生活中笑聲和美麗的重要性。

# The Struggle of Eternal Recurrence永恆輪迴的掙扎

In the third part of the novel, Zarathustra confronts the concept of eternal recurrence, which posits that all events will repeat infinitely. This idea weighs heavily on him, as it suggests that mediocrity will recur. Zarathustra encounters various figures who embody different aspects of humanity, including those who have succumbed to complacency and those who seek deeper meaning.在小說的第三部分，查拉圖斯特拉麵對永恆輪迴的概念，這個概念假定所有事件都會無限重複。 這個想法對他影響很大，因為它表明平庸將會再次出現。 查拉圖斯特拉遇到了體現人性不同面向的各種人物，包括那些屈服於自滿的人和那些尋求更深層意義的人。

He critiques the limitations imposed by Christian morality, arguing that traditional views on sex, power, and selfishness are not inherently negative. Instead, he encourages individuals to redefine these concepts in a way that affirms life. Zarathustra's teachings emphasize the need to break free from societal norms that stifle potential and to embrace life as an artwork that one can shape.他批評基督教道德所施加的限制，認為關於性、權力和自私的傳統觀點本質上並不是消極的。 相反，他鼓勵個人以肯定生命的方式重新定義這些概念。 查拉圖斯特拉的教義強調需要擺脫扼殺潛力的社會規範，並將生活視為一件可以塑造的藝術品。

# Laughing in the Face of Eternity微笑面對永恆

In the final part, Zarathustra retreats to his mountain sanctuary, awaiting the arrival of his followers. He encounters various characters who reflect the struggles of humanity. Each character represents a fragment of the Übermensch spirit, and Zarathustra invites them to his cave for a feast, emphasizing the importance of self-overcoming and joy.在最後一部分，查拉圖斯特拉退回到他的山中聖所，等待他的追隨者的到來。 他遇到了反映人類鬥爭的各種人物。 每個角色都代表了超人精神的一部分，查拉圖斯特拉邀請他們到他的洞穴享用盛宴，強調自我克服和快樂的重要性。

During the celebration, Zarathustra warns against mindless worship and highlights the interconnectedness of joy and sorrow. He concludes his journey with a hopeful message, symbolized by the appearance of a lion, representing the potential for growth and transformation. Zarathustra's final words, "My day beginneth. Arise now," encapsulate his call to embrace life and its challenges.在慶祝活動中，查拉圖斯特拉警告不要盲目崇拜，並強調歡樂和悲傷的相互關聯。 他以充滿希望的信息結束了他的旅程，以獅子的出現為象徵，代表著成長和轉變的潛力。 查拉圖斯特拉的最後一句話「我的一天開始了。現在就起來」概括了他擁抱生活及其挑戰的號召。

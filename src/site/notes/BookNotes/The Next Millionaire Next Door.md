# Introduction to Wealth Building財富累積簡介

The journey to building and sustaining wealth is often misunderstood. Contrary to popular belief, wealthy individuals do not fit the stereotype of extravagant lifestyles and elite education. Instead, many millionaires live in modest neighborhoods, prioritize financial security, and accumulate wealth through hard work, frugality, and prudent investing. This book, "The Next Millionaire Next Door" by Thomas J. Stanley and Sarah Stanley Fallaw, aims to reveal the strategies that can help anyone achieve financial independence.累積和維持財富的過程經常被誤解。 與普遍看法相反，富有的人並不符合奢侈生活方式和精英教育的刻板印象。 相反，許多百萬富翁生活在簡陋的社區，優先考慮財務安全，透過努力工作、節儉和謹慎投資來累積財富。 由托馬斯·J·史丹利和莎拉·史丹利·法洛合著的《隔壁的下一個百萬富翁》一書旨在揭示可以幫助任何人實現財務獨立的策略。

# Busting Wealth-Related Myths打破與財富相關的神話

One of the first steps to building wealth is to challenge common misconceptions about it. Many people mistakenly equate high income with wealth, but true wealth is determined by the balance of assets and liabilities. A high earner who overspends can have a negative net worth, while someone with a modest income who saves and invests wisely can accumulate significant wealth over time. Additionally, there is no single path to affluence; millionaires come from various backgrounds and employ different strategies. What they share is a disciplined approach to spending and a focus on growing their net worth. Outward appearances can be misleading, as many wealthy individuals live below their means, while those who flaunt luxury may not have substantial wealth.累積財富的第一步就是挑戰對財富的常見誤解。 很多人錯誤地將高收入等同於財富，但真正的財富是由資產和負債的平衡決定的。 超支的高收入者可能會擁有負淨資產，而收入適中的人如果明智地儲蓄和投資，則可以隨著時間的推移積累大量財富。 此外，通往富裕的道路並不單一。 百萬富翁來自不同的背景並採取不同的策略。 他們的共同點是嚴格的支出方式和對增加淨資產的關注。 外表可能會產生誤導，因為許多富有的人入不敷出，而那些炫耀奢侈的人可能沒有大量財富。

# Frugality as a Wealth-Building Strategy節儉作為一種財富累積策略

Frugality is a crucial component of wealth accumulation. The allure of luxury can distract individuals from the reality that true wealth is built through restraint and moderation. Many financially secure individuals have average incomes but excel at managing their spending. Living in a modest home, avoiding excessive housing costs, and being selective about purchases are essential practices for building wealth. Housing expenses should ideally not exceed 28% of monthly income, and individuals should prioritize quality over quantity in their purchases. By adopting a frugal lifestyle, individuals can save and invest more effectively, laying the groundwork for long-term financial security.節儉是財富累積的重要組成部分。 奢侈品的誘惑可能會分散人們對這樣一個現實的注意力：真正的財富是透過克制和節制來累積的。 許多經濟上有保障的人收入一般，但擅長管理支出。 住在簡陋的房子裡，避免過高的住房成本，並選擇性地購買，是累積財富的基本做法。 住房支出最好不超過月收入的28%，個人購買時應優先考慮品質而非數量。 透過節儉的生活方式，個人可以更有效地儲蓄和投資，為長期財務安全奠定基礎。

# Developing Financial Competency發展財務能力

Achieving financial independence requires a blend of skills, from budgeting to investment management. Designating a "chief financial officer" within a household can streamline financial responsibilities and ensure effective management. Successful households exhibit six core competencies: confidence in decision-making, frugality, responsibility for financial choices, social indifference to consumer pressures, focus on financial goals, and planning for future challenges. These competencies can be developed over time, emphasizing that wealth-building is more about discipline and perseverance than innate intelligence or elite education. Many millionaires have built their wealth through hard work and continuous learning rather than traditional academic paths.實現財務獨立需要多種技能，從預算到投資管理。 在家庭內指定一名「財務長」可以簡化財務責任並確保有效管理。 成功的家庭表現出六個核心能力：決策信心、節儉、對財務選擇的責任感、社會對消費者壓力的漠不關心、專注於財務目標以及對未來挑戰的規劃。 這些能力可以隨著時間的推移而發展，強調財富的累積更多地取決於紀律和毅力，而不是先天的智力或精英教育。 許多百萬富翁是透過努力工作和不斷學習而不是傳統的學術途徑積累了財富。

# Investing in Simple, Sustainable Options投資簡單、永續的選擇

The path to sustainable wealth often lies in disciplined investing. Rather than chasing high-risk, high-reward schemes, successful investors focus on time-tested strategies that prioritize savings and long-term growth. Retirement accounts and low-cost index funds are favored investment vehicles, as they provide consistent returns without the high fees associated with actively managed funds. The millionaire next door exemplifies patience and self-discipline, avoiding unnecessary trades and remaining committed to their investment strategy. They understand the importance of adapting their approach as their financial situation evolves, particularly as they approach retirement. By investing wisely and consistently, individuals can build substantial wealth over time.通往永續財富的道路往往在於有紀律的投資。 成功的投資者不會追逐高風險、高回報的計劃，而是專注於經過時間考驗的策略，優先考慮儲蓄和長期成長。 退休帳戶和低成本指數基金是受歡迎的投資工具，因為它們提供穩定的回報，而無需支付與主動式管理基金相關的高額費用。 隔壁的百萬富翁體現了耐心和自律，避免不必要的交易並始終致力於自己的投資策略。 他們了解隨著財務狀況的變化而調整自己的方法的重要性，特別是當他們接近退休時。 透過明智和持續的投資，個人可以隨著時間的推移累積大量財富。

# Conclusion結論

Building wealth is not about high incomes or extravagant lifestyles; it is about living below one's means, saving diligently, and making informed investment choices. By focusing on long-term financial goals and resisting the temptations of consumer culture, anyone can steadily grow their wealth. The principles outlined in "The Next Millionaire Next Door" provide a roadmap for achieving financial independence through discipline, frugality, and smart investing.累積財富並不在於高收入或奢侈的生活方式；而是在於。 它是關於量入為出、勤奮儲蓄以及做出明智的投資選擇。 透過專注於長期財務目標並抵制消費文化的誘惑，任何人都可以穩步增加財富。 《隔壁的下一個百萬富翁》中概述的原則提供了透過紀律、節儉和明智投資來實現財務獨立的路線圖。

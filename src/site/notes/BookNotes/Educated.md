# Introduction介紹

Tara Westover's memoir, "Educated," chronicles her remarkable journey from a life of religious fanaticism and isolation to one of educated empowerment. Growing up in a strict Mormon family in rural Idaho, Tara's upbringing was marked by her father's belief that formal education was a tool for government brainwashing. This memoir details her struggle for education, her experiences in college, and her eventual attainment of a doctoral degree from Cambridge University.塔拉·韋斯托弗的回憶錄《受過教育》記錄了她從宗教狂熱和孤立的生活到受教育賦權的非凡旅程。 塔拉在愛達荷州鄉村的一個嚴格的摩門教家庭長大，她的父親相信正規教育是政府洗腦的工具，她的成長過程就是這樣。 這本回憶錄詳細介紹了她的教育奮鬥、大學經歷以及最終獲得劍橋大學博士學位。

# Chapter 1: Unconventional Upbringing第一章：非傳統的成長經歷

Tara's childhood was spent on a farm, where she was the youngest of seven children. Her family’s approach to education was unconventional; none of the children attended school, and Tara had never even been to a hospital. Her father, Gene, viewed schools as indoctrination centers, while her mother, Faye, adhered to traditional roles as a homemaker and unlicensed midwife. Despite the lack of formal education, Tara learned practical skills, such as canning peaches and understanding the rhythms of nature.塔拉的童年是在一個農場度過的，她是那裡七個孩子中最年輕的一個。 她的家庭的教育方式非常規。 孩子們都沒有上學，塔拉甚至從未去過醫院。 她的父親吉恩 (Gene) 將學校視為思想灌輸中心，而她的母親費伊 (Faye) 則堅持傳統的家庭主婦和無證助產士角色。 儘管缺乏正規教育，塔拉還是學會了實用技能，例如罐裝桃子和理解自然的節奏。

The Westover siblings were largely left to educate themselves, with minimal guidance from their parents.

# Chapter 3: First Job and Exposure to the Outside World第3章：第一份工作和接觸外面的世界

At eleven, Tara took her first job babysitting, which exposed her to a world beyond her family's isolated existence.
